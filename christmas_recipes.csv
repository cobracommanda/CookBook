Ultra-Crispy Slow-Roasted Pork Shoulder Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Pork shoulder, also referred to as pork butt, starts out as a hulking mass of tough meat wrapped in a thick skin. This recipe starts the pork in a low oven for a leisurely eight-hour roast, resulting in spoonably tender meat. Then, we finish the shoulder off in a ripping hot 500°F oven to rapidly heat the skin until it's shatteringly crisp.
If you want to serve your pork with a sauce, try making a pan sauce (see note), or pair it with sweet and spicy nuoc cham, Chinese style char siu, Cuban mojo, a sweet Memphis-style barbecue sauce, or a bright Argentinian chimichurri. Or better yet, serve it with a whole selection.","Yield:serves 8 to 12
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:9 hours
Rated: 4.84375","Ingredients
1 whole bone-in, skin-on pork shoulder, 8 to 12 pounds total
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 250°F (121°C).
2.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil (see note) and set a wire rack inside it. Place a piece of parchment paper on top of the wire rack. Season pork on all sides liberally with salt and pepper and place on parchment paper. Transfer to oven and roast until knife or fork inserted into side shows very little resistance when twisted, about 8 hours total.
3.
Remove pork from oven and tent with foil. Let rest at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours. Increase oven to 500°F and allow to preheat. Return pork to the oven and roast until skin is blistered and puffed, rotating every 5 minutes, about 20 minutes total. Remove from oven, tent with foil and allow to rest an additional 15 minutes. Serve by picking in the kitchen or just bring it to the table and let guests pick meat and crispy skin themselves, dipping into sauce of their choice on the side (see note).

Smothered Turkey Wings Recipe,,"[Photographs: Jillian Atkinson]
Growing up in the South, I ate turkey wings about as often as chicken or fish in my family's dinner rotation. Everyone’s family had their own special way of preparing them—some boiled the wings first, ensuring they'd be tender; my grandmother did hers with a little bell pepper and onion, and would make a slurry to form a thin gravy that we'd pour over and eat with rice; and one trick I learned recently is to use dry French onion soup mix in the gravy for lots of flavor without much work.
No matter these differences, the wings always end up baked in the oven, cooking in their own juices and seasonings—this method of braising and smothering the wings in their own rich gravy makes for perfectly cooked meat that's far more flavorful and a lot less likely to dry out than a typical Thanksgiving turkey. Plus, their size is much better for cooking for smaller crowds (and storing the leftovers).
In this recipe, the wings are first soaked in a wet brine made with salt, brown sugar, and a few herbs and spices. Wet brining isn't a technique Serious Eats often recommends for turkey, but it works well with the wings: They're smaller and have more surface area compared to a larger bird or roast, allowing salt and flavorings to make more of an impact throughout, plus the added water weight gained during brining guarantees juiciness even after long cooking (and those exuded liquids just end up in the gravy anyway—no harm done).
After that, I sear the wings in a Dutch oven, followed by aromatic vegetables like onion, carrot, and celery. Once they've softened, I transfer the vegetables to a bowl and use the same vessel to make a simple gravy, whipped up with a roasty brown roux and some chicken stock. Then, the vegetables, gravy, and wings all go into the oven to braise until the wings are tender and the gravy has thickened properly, thanks in part to the roux and in part to the collagen in the wings that breaks down during cooking into sauce-improving gelatin.
As for the wings themselves, most stores carry them, but you can usually find the best ones at a local butcher. Back home in the Southeast, I could find turkey wings all year round; both whole wings and split. But here in the Southwest where I currently live, they’re much more seasonal. I personally prefer to buy smallish wings and drums with the tips still on. Huge wings you’d find at your local state fair are still delicious, but will take longer to cook and, at least to me, don’t have the same tender texture or depth of flavor.","Yield:Serves 3 to 4
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:2 hours 30 minutes plus brining time","Ingredients
For the Brine:
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2 ounces; 55g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce; 15g) light brown sugar
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
2 bay leaves
6 turkey wing flats or 3 whole turkey wings split into flats and drums (about 3 pounds/1.3kg total; see note)
1 shallot (3/4 ounce; 20g), cut in half
5 sprigs fresh thyme
1 large sprig fresh rosemary
For the Braise:
3 1/2 tablespoons (50ml) vegetable, canola, or other neutral oil, divided
1 medium (8-ounce; 225g) yellow onion, thinly sliced
1 large (5-ounce; 140g) carrot, peeled and thinly sliced crosswise into rounds
1 celery rib (about 2 ounces; 55g), thinly sliced on the bias
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium broth, plus more if needed
1 teaspoon dried sage powder
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
Kosher salt","1.
For the Brine: In a large mixing bowl, prepare an ice bath. In a 2-quart saucepan, stir together 1 quart (1L) water with salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, and bay leaves over medium heat until brine reaches a gentle simmer and salt and sugar have dissolved. Set saucepan in ice bath, making sure it doesn't cause an overflow, and stir brine until cooled to room temperature. In a large zipper-lock bag, add turkey wings, shallot, thyme, and rosemary. Carefully pour cooled brine on top, seal, pushing out any excess air, and refrigerate for at least 3 and up to 8 hours.
2.
Drain wings, discarding brine and aromatics. Dry wings well with paper towels. Set aside.
3.
For the Braise: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook wings, turning, until golden brown on both sides, about 7 minutes. Transfer wings to a tray or platter and set aside.
4.
Lower heat to medium and add onion, carrot, and celery to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until onions are translucent and carrots and celery have softened slightly, about 4 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a heatproof bowl or plate.
5.
Add remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons (35ml) oil to Dutch oven. Stir in flour and cook, stirring, until flour is a little darker than the color of peanut butter, about 10 minutes (the timing can vary here, so be sure to follow the color indication).
6.
Whisk in stock in 1/2-cup increments, whisking well between additions to ensure a smooth texture, until all the liquid has been added. Bring to a low boil, then whisk in sage, black pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, and smoked paprika. Season very lightly with salt. Remove from heat.
7.
In a baking dish large enough to hold the wings in one layer, spread vegetables in an even layer. Arrange wings on top in an even layer, top side down, then pour the pan gravy on top until it comes halfway up the wings (this should be all of the gravy); if there's not enough, add enough additional stock to bring the liquid halfway up the wings.
8.
Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil, then bake, turning once halfway through so wings are top side up, until turkey wings are fork-tender, about 1 hours 15 minutes. Turn oven up to 375°F (190°C) and remove foil from baking dish. Return wings to oven and cook until gravy has thickened to a spoon-coating consistency and wings have darkened slightly, about 15 minutes longer. Season gravy with additional salt, if needed, and let rest 10 minutes.
9.
Serve smothered wings with their gravy on rice, mashed potatoes, or as desired.

Crisp-Skinned Spatchcocked (Butterflied) Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe,,"[Video: Vicky Wasik, Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]
Spatchcocking is a method of removing the turkey's backbone to flatten its body prior to putting in the oven. This flatter shape ensures that the meat cooks more evenly and more quickly, allowing the legs to reach a safe temperature without overcooking the breast. The result is hands-down the easiest, most reliable route to a juicy, moist turkey with incredibly crisp skin. It may not look like a traditional Thanksgiving centerpiece, but your tastebuds will certainly thank you.
For best results, we recommend dry-brining your turkey by following the instructions here. If dry-brining, you can omit any additional salt added to the turkey in step two.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 4.7307692307692","Ingredients
3 large onions, roughly chopped (about 1 1/2 quarts)
3 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 quart)
4 stalks celery, roughly chopped (about 1 quart
12 thyme sprigs
1 whole turkey (12 to 14 pounds total), butterflied according to these instructions, backbone, neck, and giblets reserved
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 quarts low-sodium homemade or store-bought chicken or turkey broth
2 bay leaves
3 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons flour","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. Scatter 2/3rds of onions, carrots, celery and thyme sprigs across bottom of pan. Place slotted broiler rack or wire rack directly on top of vegetables.
2.
Pat turkey dry with paper towels and rub on all surfaces with 1 tablespoon oil. Season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper (if using a brined, salted, or Kosher turkey, omit salting step, see note). Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on the breast bone to flatten the breasts slightly.
3.
Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the breast registers 150°F, and the thighs register at least 165°F, about 80 minutes.
4.
While turkey roasts, make the gravy. Roughly chop the neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 3 quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, another 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Allow to cook 45 minutes, then strain through a fine mesh strainer into a 2 quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from the surface of the broth.
5.
Melt butter over medium-high heat in a 2 quart saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until flour is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in a thin, steady stream until it it all incorporated. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to about 1 quart, about 20 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep gravy warm.
6.
When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from out of the roasting pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and dicard. Whisk juices into gravy.

8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g)
1 standard ice cube (about 2 tablespoons; 30mL frozen water)
10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups; 280g)
3/4 teaspoon (3g) baking soda
2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt (4g)

8 ounces (225g) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks
Coarse sea salt, for garnish","1.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes, whisking occasionally. (Alternatively, whisk over an ice bath to hasten the process.)
2.
Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.
3.
Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add chocolate and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up to 3 days.
4.
When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 325°F. Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or a spoon, place scoops of cookie dough onto a nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheet. Each ball should measure approximately 3 tablespoons in volume, and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on each sheet. Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown around edges but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through baking.
5.
Remove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle very lightly with coarse salt and gently press salt down to embed. Let cool for 2 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
6.
Repeat steps 3 through 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie jar at room temperature for up to 5 days.

Thanksgiving Stuffed Roast Pumpkins Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Video.]
At Thanksgiving and other holidays, vegetarians deserve better than a cobbled-together meal of side dishes. These stuffed pumpkins, filled with mushrooms, kale, kabocha squash, and cheese, are packed with autumnal flavors, making for a meatless main course that can rival any holiday roast.","Yield:Makes 4 stuffed pumpkins, serving 8
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 4.6666666666667","Ingredients
For the Roasted Pumpkins and Squash:
4 small sugar pumpkins (1 1/2 to 2 pounds each; 675 to 900g)
1 large skin-on kabocha squash (about 2 pounds; 900g), halved and seeded
Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Mushroom and Kale Filling:
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound (450g) shiitake mushrooms (or a mix of mushrooms, such as oyster, chanterelles, and beech), stemmed, cleaned, and thinly sliced (see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 ounces (225g) lacinato kale (a.k.a. dinosaur, Tuscan, or black kale), tough stems removed, leaves cut into 1-inch pieces
4 tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
2 medium shallots, finely minced (about 1/2 cup; 80g)
1 medium clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
1/4 cup (60ml) sherry
1 tablespoon (15ml) sherry vinegar
For the Spiced Cream:
2 cups (475ml) heavy cream
1 cup (240ml) whole milk
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
Pinch ground cloves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Glaze (optional):
2 tablespoons (40g) red miso paste
2 tablespoons (30ml) honey
1 tablespoon (15ml) water
To Finish:
10 ounces (285g) high-quality rustic bread, cut into 3/4-inch dice and toasted until dry
3/4 cup (120g) pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds), toasted
3/4 cup (90g) pecans, toasted and roughly chopped
8 ounces (225g) shredded Gruyère cheese","1.
Roast the Pumpkins and Squash: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Working with one pumpkin at a time, use a sharp paring knife to cut the top of the pumpkin off in one piece (as when making a jack-o'-lantern). Carefully run knife along the cavity of the pumpkin to loosen seeds and stringy pulp, then use a spoon to scoop them out and scrape the cavity clean. Using the paring knife, scrape seeds and pulp from the tops as well. Discard seeds and pulp or reserve for another use (try roasting the seeds with one of our seasoning combinations for a snack). Repeat with remaining pumpkins.
2.
Place kabocha squash halves cut side up on a work surface along with pumpkins. Lightly drizzle the cut and inner surfaces of kabocha squash, pumpkins, and pumpkin tops with olive oil, rubbing them with your hands to evenly coat. Season heavily with salt and pepper.
3.
Place pumpkin tops on pumpkins, then set pumpkins on prepared baking sheet. Set kabocha squash, cut side down, on the same baking sheet. Roast until kabocha squash is tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife, and sugar pumpkins have slightly softened, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lift pumpkin tops from pumpkins to allow steam to escape and set all roasted squash aside to cool on baking sheet.
4.
Once the kabocha squash is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop the flesh into a medium bowl and roughly mash with the back of the spoon. Discard squash skin. Season mashed squash with salt and pepper and set aside.
5.
Meanwhile, Make the Mushroom Filling: In a large 12-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 10 minutes. Push mushrooms to outer edge of skillet, add kale to now-empty center of skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until kale is slightly wilted and softened and has mixed with mushrooms, about 3 minutes.
6.
Push mushrooms and kale to outer edge of skillet and add butter to center of skillet. Once butter has melted and begun foaming, add shallots, garlic, and thyme to center of skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sherry and sherry vinegar and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper and transfer mixture to a heatproof medium bowl to cool.
7.
Make the Spiced Cream: After squashes have cooled and kabocha is mashed, whisk together cream, milk, cinnamon, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large liquid measuring cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
8.
Make the Glaze (Optional): Whisk ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.
9.
To Stuff and Finish Pumpkins: Stuff pumpkins by evenly dividing and layering half the ingredients in the following order: mashed kabocha squash, bread, mushroom-kale mixture, pepitas, pecans, Gruyère, and spiced cream. Gently press mixture down with your hands, then repeat layering process with remaining half of stuffing ingredients. If glazing the pumpkins, use a pastry brush to paint glaze onto pumpkins and pumpkin tops.
10.
Roast pumpkins on baking sheet, without tops, until top layer of cheese is melted and lightly browned, and pumpkins are tender and easily pierced by a paring knife, 30 to 45 minutes. Set tops on pumpkins and continue roasting for 10 minutes longer. Remove pumpkins from oven and cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Using a large spatula, carefully transfer pumpkins to a serving platter. Serve immediately.

","Consistently moist brisket with a smoky bark. [Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]
Good brisket is often called the Holy Grail of barbecue—an apt description, given how rarely you find good smoked brisket in the wild. I've tasted barbecued brisket all over the country, and, while you can certainly find some that's truly transcendent, the vast majority of the time, it's a dry, bland disappointment. Sous vide cooking changes all that by allowing even a novice to produce brisket that's as moist and tender as the very best stuff you'll find in Austin or Lockhart.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:32 to 80 hours
Rated: 4","Ingredients
2 ounces coarsely ground black peppercorns (about 1/3 cup; 55g); see note
2 1/4 ounces kosher salt (about 1/4 cup; 65g)
1/4 ounce (10g) pink salt, such as Prague Powder Curing Salt (optional; see note)
1 flat-cut or point-cut brisket, about 5 pounds (2.25kg); see note
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke, such as Wright's Liquid Smoke (optional; see note)
Dill pickles, sliced yellow onion, and white bread, for serving","1.
Combine pepper, salt, and pink salt (if using) in a small bowl. Rub two-thirds of mixture evenly over surface of brisket. Reserve remaining one-third of mixture. Slice brisket in half crosswise in order to fit into large vacuum bags.
2.
Place each brisket half in a vacuum bag. (Fold over the top of each bag while you add brisket so that no rub or juices get on the edges of bags, which can weaken the seal.) Add 4 drops (about 1/8 teaspoon) liquid smoke, if using, to each bag. Seal bags using a vacuum sealer and let rest for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.
3.
Set your precision cooker to 135°F (57°C) for brisket with a tender, steak-like texture, or 155°F (68°C) for more traditionally textured brisket that falls apart when you pull at it. Add brisket to water bath and cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or table tennis balls. Cook for 24 to 36 hours at 155°F or 36 to 72 hours at 135°F. Allow cooked brisket to cool at least to room temperature before proceeding (an ice bath can speed up this process). Brisket can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 1 week before finishing.
4.
To Finish on the Grill: Light 1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.
5.
Remove brisket from bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket. Place brisket on cooler side of grill, fat cap up. Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. (If using a gas grill, wrap wood chunks loosely in aluminum foil before placing over hotter side of grill.) Cover and allow brisket to smoke, adjusting vents to maintain a temperature between 275 and 300°F (135 and 149°C) and adding 2 to 3 wood chunks twice during cooking. Smoke until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 3 hours. Continue with step 7.
6.
To Finish in the Oven: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). (If your oven has a convection setting, turn it on and adjust heat to 275°F/135°C instead.) Remove brisket from sous vide bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt-and-pepper mixture into surface of brisket. Place brisket on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, fat cap up, and place in oven. Roast until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 2 hours. Continue with step 7.
7.
Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest until the temperature drops to between 145 and 165°F (63 and 74°C), about 30 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve with white bread, dill pickles, and sliced onion.

2 ounces (60g) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
2 cups (480ml) heavy cream
2 medium cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 to 3 1/2 pounds (1.4 to 1.6kg) russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/8 inch thick on a mandoline slicer (5 to 6 medium potatoes; see note)
2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Combine cheeses in a large bowl. Transfer 1/3 of cheese mixture to a separate bowl and set aside. Add cream, garlic, and thyme to cheese mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add potato slices and toss with hands until every slice is coated with cream mixture, making sure to separate any slices that are sticking together to get the cream mixture in between them.
2.
Grease a 2-quart casserole dish with butter. Pick up a handful of potatoes, organizing them into a neat stack, and lay them in the casserole dish with their edges aligned vertically. Continue placing potatoes in casserole, working around the perimeter and into the center until all potatoes have been added. Potatoes should be very tightly packed. If necessary, slice additional potato, coat with cream mixture, and add to casserole (see note). Pour excess cream/cheese mixture evenly over potatoes until the mixture comes half way up the sides of the casserole. You may not need all excess liquid (see note).

Cover tightly with foil and transfer to oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until top is pale golden brown, about 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove from oven, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and return to oven. Bake until deep golden brown and crisp on top, about 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let rest for a few minutes, and serve.

Classic Butternut Squash Soup Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Smooth and silky butternut squash soup is a cold-weather staple. The secret to the most intense, sweetest flavor is to roast the squash until it's deeply browned and caramelized, then purée it with a base of browned butter and golden sautéed onions. A dollop of sour cream–spiked, cinnamon- and nutmeg-spiced whipped cream and frizzled sage leaves complete this wintertime classic.","Yield:Makes about 2 quarts (1.9L), serving about 6
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 45 minutes
Rated: 4.6666666666667","Ingredients
1 (2 1/2–pound; 1kg) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large (8-ounce; 215g) carrot, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
7 tablespoons (100g) unsalted butter, divided (see note)
1 large (8-ounce; 215g) yellow onion, thinly sliced
4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
4 cups (1L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock, plus more as needed
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3/4 cup (180ml) heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup (60ml) sour cream
Pinch ground cinnamon
Pinch nutmeg
20 fresh sage leaves (optional; see note)","1.
Preheat oven to 425°F (230°C). Toss squash and carrot with olive oil and arrange on 2 rimmed baking sheets, being sure not to overcrowd the sheets. Roast until squash and carrot are very well browned on a couple of sides, about 40 minutes; use a thin metal spatula to turn pieces 2 or 3 times during cooking. Set aside.
2.
In a large saucepan, cook 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat until just starting to brown. Add onion and garlic, lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly golden, about 10 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent burning.
3.
Add squash and carrot to saucepan and remove from heat. Pour 1/2 cup (120ml) stock into each baking sheet and scrape up any browned bits, then pour into saucepan. Add remaining stock, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf and return to medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are very soft, about 10 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.
4.
Using a high-powered blender, standard countertop blender or immersion blender, blend soup until completely smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Return soup to saucepan and thin, if necessary, with additional stock until desired consistency is reached. Keep warm.
5.
Meanwhile, in a stand mixer, or using a handheld mixer or whisk, beat cream and sour cream with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt, until stiff. Set aside.
6.
If making frizzled sage leaves, melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat, swirling gently, until foamy and just beginning to brown. Add sage leaves, swirling to submerge, and cook until frizzled, about 15 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage to a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle very lightly with salt.
7.
Ladle soup into warmed bowls, spoon dollops of spiced whipped cream into each one, and top with frizzled sage, if using. Serve right away.

Sous vide is a fantastic method for cooking holiday roasts. It delivers reliably moist and tender results, frees up your oven for other tasks, requires almost no supervision during cooking, and makes it very easy to hold the roast hot and ready to serve until your guests are ready.
That said, sous vide turkey comes with a few problems. We've solved these issues to give you a recipe that produces turkey cooked exactly how you like it, with deep, roasty flavors and extra-crispy skin to boot.

For the Turkey:
1 large whole skin-on, bone-in turkey breast (about 5 pounds; 2.2kg)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Gravy:
1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
2 ribs celery, roughly chopped
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce
3 tablespoons (45g) butter
1/4 cup (40g) flour","1.
Carefully remove turkey skin in a single piece and set aside. Using a sharp boning knife, remove breast meat from breastbone. Set breastbone aside. Season turkey generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Place 1 breast half, cut side facing up, on a work surface. Place second breast half facedown, so the fat end aligns with the skinny end of the first breast half. Gently form into an even cylinder.
2.
Tie turkey breast at 1-inch intervals using butcher's twine. Transfer to a zipper-lock bag. Turkey can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before proceeding.
3.
Heat a sous vide water bath to 145°F (63°C), or to desired temperature according to chart above. With bag open, slowly lower bagged turkey into water, letting water pressure squeeze air out of bag until just the seal remains above the waterline. Seal bag completely. Let turkey cook for 2 1/2 hours (or according to chart above). Meanwhile, make the crispy skin and gravy.
4.
For the Crispy Skin: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Spread skin evenly over a piece of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place a second sheet of parchment on top and carefully squeeze out any air bubbles using the side of your hand. Place a second rimmed baking sheet on top and transfer to oven.
5.
Roast until skin is deep brown and crisp (it will crisp further on cooling), 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool and set aside at room temperature. Turkey skin can be roasted in advance, cooled completely, then stored, loosely covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days. To re-crisp, place in a hot oven for a few minutes just before serving.
6.
For the Gravy: Using a cleaver, chop breastbone into 1-inch chunks. In a medium saucepan over high heat, heat oil until smoking. Add breastbone, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You should have a little over 1 quart (900ml) of fortified stock; if not, add water or more chicken stock to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.
7.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add fortified broth in a thin, steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups (720ml). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
8.
When turkey is cooked, remove from water bath and unseal bag. Carefully remove butcher's twine. Cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices for serving. Fan slices out on a warmed serving platter or cutting board. Break skin into serving-sized pieces and add to platter, along with a pitcher of gravy. Serve immediately.

This all-purpose bread recipe produces a crusty plain white loaf that's classic and delicious. The quantities given here yield two crusty hearth loaves with an open crumb, and is a great starting point for learning to bake bread at home.","Yield:Makes 2 large (850g) loaves
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:About 5 hours
Rated: 4.3913043478261","Ingredients
1000 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
700 grams room-temperature water, divided if using active dry yeast
22 grams salt
4 grams instant yeast, 5 grams active dry yeast, or 10 grams fresh yeast (see note)
Vegetable, canola, or other neutral oil, for greasing","1.
If using instant or fresh yeast, combine flour and all of the water in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If using active dry yeast, combine flour with 650 grams water and combine yeast with 50 grams warm water; let yeast stand until foamy. Mix flour and water at low speed until they are fully incorporated and form a uniform dough. Alternatively, combine flour and water in a mixing bowl and mix using a dough spatula until dough forms. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.
2.
Add salt, along with either the instant yeast, fresh yeast, or the active-dry yeast solution, and mix at low speed or by hand until salt and yeast are fully incorporated and dough is smooth.
3.
Turn stand mixer up to medium-high speed and mix until the dough feels elastic and bounces partway back when indented with your thumb, about 3-5 minutes. If mixing by hand, skip this step.
4.
Working with oiled hands, gently transfer dough, being careful not to tear its surface, to a lightly oiled mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Uncover dough. Working with wet hands and/or a plastic bench scraper, loosen the dough, then gently lift and pull the dough down towards you, folding it in half. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat, folding the dough in half towards you. Now give the bowl a half turn and repeat the fold a final time, being careful not to compress it too much. Lastly, pull the unfolded side of your dough carefully up from the bottom, and pull it up and over to form a neat package. Re-cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough has increased in volume by half, about 1 hour 30 minutes longer.
5.
Transfer dough in one piece to a lightly floured work surface. Using a bench knife, divide dough in half and shape each portion into a ball. Dust the tops of the dough balls with flour, cover with a towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.
6.
Shape the dough into rounds once again, gently folding the dough over itself similar to how you did before, but even more carefully now. Now flip the dough ball over so that the seams you just created are on the bottom and a smooth surface is on top. Let dough rest on the work surface, seam-side down, for 5 minutes. Transfer each dough ball, seam-side up, to a bowl or basket lined with a lightly floured linen cloth or plain, not-fuzzy kitchen towel. Refrigerate dough balls or store in a cool place until dough has nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes.
7.
Meanwhile, set a Dutch oven on the oven's bottom rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C)(if your oven has a convection setting, do not use it).
8.
Remove 1 loaf from the refrigerator and gently turn it out, seam-side down, into the preheated Dutch oven. With a razor or paring knife, score the full surface of the dough with 2 parallel lines roughly 3 inches apart. With a spray bottle filled with water, lightly spritz the surface of the dough. Cover and bake for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 450°F (232°C)and bake for 15 minutes longer. Uncover and bake until crust is dark brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
9.
Transfer loaf to a wire rack. Allow to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing. Return Dutch oven to oven, and reheat at 500°F (260°C) for 10 minutes. Then repeat with the remaining ball of dough.

The Ultimate Homemade Green Bean Casserole Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
The classic Campbell's green bean casserole is a staple on many Thanksgiving tables. But there are easy ways to upgrade the out-of-the-can version. If you're intimidated by the length and number of steps in this recipe, bear in mind that you don't need to use the whole thing—try canned fried onions instead of frying your own, for instance. Or, to make it even easier, stick with two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of making your own creamy mushroom sauce.
This green bean casserole can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for up to two days before it's baked and topped with additional fried shallots (see note).","Yield:Serves 8 to 12
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 1/2 hours

1 1/2 pounds (675g) white button mushrooms, rinsed and spun dry in a salad spinner
2 teaspoons (10ml) soy sauce
2 teaspoons (10ml) lemon juice from 1 lemon

2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated on a Microplane grater
1/4 cup (30g) flour
Freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds (900g) green beans, ends trimmed, cut into 2-inch segments","1.
Combine shallots and oil in a wok or medium nonstick saucepan. Shallots should barely stick out above level of oil. Place over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are completely soft, about 12 minutes.
2.
Meanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with 6 layers of paper towels. Continue to cook shallots, stirring constantly, until shallots are light golden brown, about 8 minutes.
3.
Immediately strain through a fine-mesh strainer set in a heat-proof bowl or saucepan. Set shallot oil aside. You should have about 2 cups of fried shallots.
4.
Transfer fried shallots to paper towels. Lift up one end of top paper towel and roll shallots off onto second. Blot with first towel to absorb excess oil. Repeat 4 more times, transferring shallots from one paper towel to the next, until only one paper towel remains. Season well with salt.
5.
Allow shallots to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Once they've cooled, transfer to a sealed airtight container. Shallots can be made up to 1 month in advance.
6.
Smash mushrooms under the bottom of a large skillet until broken into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. Roughly chop into pieces approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch in size. Set aside.
7.
Combine soy sauce, lemon juice, chicken stock, and heavy cream in a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or medium bowl.
8.
Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) reserved shallot oil (save remainder in an airtight container for another use) and butter to a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Heat over high heat until butter is melted and foaming subsides. Add mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms begin to sizzle, 6 to 10 minutes.
9.
Reduce heat to medium-high. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden blond, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, add stock and cream mixture.
10.
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until mixture achieves a texture between pancake batter and heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
11.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bring 1 gallon (3.8L) water and 1/4 cup (48g) kosher salt to a boil over high heat. Fill a large bowl with 1 quart ice cubes and 2 quarts (1.9L) water.

","This lasagna is creamy, cheesy, and packed with layers of spinach flavor. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
I find the process of making lasagna extremely relaxing. I love working on the sauces and fillings and carefully assembling them all in a casserole dish before baking. Today we're going to look one of the classics. Creamy, cheesy, spinach lasagna flavored with a hint of nutmeg and a combination of white sauce and fresh ricotta. And while I'll often opt for the ease and convenience of no-boil lasagna noodles, today we're going to go all-in with store-bought fresh pasta.
Why this recipe works:
Sautéing the spinach instead of blanching or microwaving it improves flavor, while chopping allows you to evenly incorporate it into every bite.
A mixture of smoothly processed ricotta and ricotta that hasn't been in the food processor gives the lasagna a creamy flavor while still maintaining the classic small curds of ricotta in the finished dish.
Stacks and stacks of fresh pasta make this dish about the pasta, not just the fillings.
Note: Most store-bought ricotta is terrible. Look for a brand like Calabro, which contains nothing more than milk, salt, and either an acid or starter. If quality ricotta is unavailable, substitute cottage cheese instead.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 4.75","Ingredients
For the Spinach:
2 tablespoons butter, divided
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, finely minced (about 1/2 cup)
6 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds fresh flat or curly spinach leaves, washed and dried
For the Ricotta:
2 pounds fresh ricotta cheese (see note)
2 eggs
4 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
For the White Sauce:
4 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup flour
1 quart (4 cups) whole milk
12 ounces grated low moisture mozzarella cheese
12 ounces grated Comté, Gruyère, or Emmenthaler cheese
For Assembly:
1 1/2 pounds (enough sheets to make 12 layers) fresh lasagna noodles","1.
For the Spinach: Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add shallots and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add a few large handfuls of spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted. Continue adding spinach a handful at a time until it is all in the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until spinach expels its moisture and most of that moisture evaporates, leaving a dry bottom as you stir. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
2.
Transfer spinach to a fine mesh strainer set over the sink and press out excess moisture with a rubber spatula. Let spinach continue to drain as you prepare the ricotta mixture.
3.
For the Ricotta: Transfer half of the ricotta, both eggs, the Parmesan, and the nutmeg to the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Process until completely smooth, about 1 minute.
4.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl but do not wipe out food processor. Transfer spinach to food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add spinach and remaining ricotta to the ricotta mixture and fold gently to combine.
5.
For the White Sauce: Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add flour and increase heat to medium high. Cook, stirring butter and flour with a whisk until paled golden blond, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in milk. Continue to cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat and add 3/4 of mozzarella and Comté cheese. Whisk until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6.
To Assemble: Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta sheets a few at a time and cook until barely tender, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer and run under cool water until well chilled. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel in a single layer. Continue until all pasta is par-cooked and dried.
7.
Drizzle a small amount of white sauce over the bottom of a lasagna pan or large casserole. Add a layer of noodles. Top with 1/12th of spinach mixture and 1/12th of remaining white sauce. Continue layering pasta, spinach, and white sauce until you lay down the top sheet of pasta.
8.
Spread remaining spinach mixture evenly over the top. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Comté cheese and drizzle with remaining white sauce. Spread into an even layer with a rubber spatula.
9.
Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until bubble and lightly browned, about 20 minutes longer. Let rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, then slice and serve.

Baba ganoush, a Middle Eastern eggplant- and tahini-based dip, takes on a concentrated smoky flavor when the eggplant is first charred over a gas flame or on the grill (a broiler works, too), then spun in a salad spinner to remove moisture from the flesh. Slowly emulsifying the olive oil with the tahini and eggplant mixture gives this vegan dip a creamy yet varied texture.
This baba ganoush can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. Let it come back to room temperature before serving.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:45 minutes (1 1/2 hours if using a broiler)
Rated: 4.5","Ingredients
3 medium Italian eggplants (about 2 pounds/900g total)
3 medium cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons (30ml) juice from 1 lemon, plus more as desired
3 tablespoons (45ml) tahini
1/3 cup (80ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves
Kosher salt","1.
If Using a Gas Burner or Grill (recommended): Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat and place eggplants directly over heat source. Cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until eggplants are completely tender and well charred on all sides, 30 to 40 minutes. Wrap with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.
2.
If Using the Broiler: Adjust rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place eggplants on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides and completely tender, about 1 hour. Eggplants should be very, very tender when cooked. Test near the stem and bottom ends; if a toothpick or skewer meets any resistance, continue cooking. Remove from oven and gather up foil, crimping it around the eggplants to form a sealed package. Let the eggplants rest for 15 minutes. Continue to step 3.
3.
Open foil package. Working with one eggplant at a time, use a sharp paring knife to slit each eggplant open lengthwise. Carefully scoop out soft flesh with a large spoon and transfer to a strainer set in a large bowl. Once all eggplant is scooped, pick out any stray bits of skin and blackened flesh and discard.
4.
Transfer eggplant to a salad spinner, distributing it evenly around the perimeter. Spin gently until all excess moisture is extracted. Discard all drippings, wipe out large bowl, and return eggplant to bowl.
5.
Add garlic and lemon juice to eggplant and stir vigorously with a fork until eggplant breaks down into a rough paste, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stirring constantly and vigorously, add tahini, followed by the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The mixture should become pale and creamy. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt, plus more lemon juice if desired.
6.
Transfer to a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve with warm pita bread or vegetables for dipping. Baba ganoush can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Let baba ganoush warm to room temperature before serving.

","Roast beef tenderloin is the most tender cut of meat around. [Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]
Whole-roasted beef tenderloin is a once-a-year celebratory dish that can be fantastic if done properly. The problem is, its extra-lean meat dries out and overcooks very easily. Our slow-roasting reverse-sear method ensures perfectly medium-rare meat from edge to center, with a nicely browned, flavorful crust.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:4 hours, plus up to 32 hours resting time (see note)
Rated: 4.9375","Ingredients
1 center-cut trimmed beef tenderloin, 2 to 3 pounds (900g to 1.4kg; see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter
4 sprigs thyme
1 shallot, roughly sliced
Finely minced chives, for serving
Coarse sea salt, such as fleur de sel or Maldon, for serving
1 recipe Horseradish Cream Sauce, for serving","1.
The Day Before: Using butcher's twine, tie tenderloin at 1-inch intervals using butcher's knots. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered at least overnight and up to 2 nights.
2.
When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F (107°C). Place baking sheet with rack and tenderloin in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 120 to 125°F (49 to 52°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes. Cut and remove twine.

","Porchetta, the Italian roast of slow-roasted fennel-scented juicy pork surrounded with crisp, crackling skin, is the perfect centerpiece for a special-occasional meal. While most recipes call for pork loin and pork belly, this all-belly version makes for an extra-aromatic, crispy and salty twist on the classic, and it comes together easily once you have the right piece of meat.
Note: Herbs and aromatics can be substituted or altered according to taste. I find it easiest to work with a whole belly at a time and if a smaller roast is desired, to split it in half and freeze half while still raw. Wrapped tightly in foil and plastic wrap, it should last for several months in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and proceed with cooking steps as instructed. To cook with potatoes, cut 4 pounds russet potatoes into 2-inch chunks and boil in salted water until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Add to roasting pan in the middle of step 6, tossing them with the pig's drippings to coat. Continue roasting the porchetta with the potatoes in the pan. Turn the potatoes with a spatula every 45 minutes or so as they roast.
If you're using a rimmed baking sheet and still want to roast potatoes, you can pour off the drippings in the middle fo step 6, toss them then the par-boiled potatoes, then place the potatoes on a separate rimmed baking sheet in a rack below the porchetta. Turn the potatoes every 45 minutes or so as they roast.","Yield:12 to 15
Active time: 2 hours
Total time:1 day
Rated: 4.9","Ingredients
1 whole boneless, rind-on pork belly, about 12 to 15 pounds
2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
3 tablespoons whole fennel seed
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper
3 tablespoons finely chopped rosemary, sage, or thyme leaves
12 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater
Kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking powder","1.
Place pork belly skin-side down on a large cutting board. Using a sharp chef's knife, score flesh at an angle using strokes about 1-inch apart. Rotate knife 90 degrees and repeat to create a diamond pattern in the flesh.
2.
Toast peppercorns and fennel seed in a small skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind until roughly crushed.
3.
Season pork liberally with salt then sprinkle with crushed pepper and fennel, red pepper, chopped herbs, and microplaned garlic. Use your hands to rub the mixture deeply into the cracks and crevices in the meat.
4.
Roll belly into a tight log and push to top of cutting board, seam-side down. Cut 12 to 18 lengths of kitchen twine long enough to tie around the pork and lay them down in regular intervals along your cutting board, about 1-inch apart each. Lay rolled pork seam-side down on top of strings. Working from the outermost strings towards the center, tie up roast tightly. Combine 2 tablespoons kosher salt with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Rub mixture over entire surface of porchetta.
5.
If roast is too large and unwieldy, carefully slice in half with a sharp chef's knife. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate at least overnight and up to three days. If desired, porchetta can also be frozen at this point for future use (see note)
6.
Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Place pork in a v-rack set in a large roasting pan, or if cooking both halves at the same time, on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place roasting pan in oven and roast until internal temperature of pork reaches 160°F, about two hours, basting with pan drippings every half hour. If you'd like to cook potatoes along with the porchetta, see note. Continue roasting until a knife or skewer inserted into the pork shows very little resistance asides from the outer layer of skin, about two hours longer.
7.
Increase oven temperature to 500°F and continue roasting until completely crisp and blistered, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Alternatively, you can remove the roast from the oven and tent with foil for up to two hours before finishing it in a preheated 500°F oven.
8.
Tent with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife into 1-inch thick disks and serve.

Perfect Prime Rib Recipe,"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/20151202-prime-rib-red-wine-jus-step-by-step-kenji-15-750x563.jpg
","[Photographs and video: J. Kenji López-Alt]
Prime rib is one of our favorite cuts of beef. It's also expensive, which means you want the best, most reliable results possible. This recipe takes advantage of the reverse sear method to yield prime rib with a deep brown, crisp, crackly salty crust surrounding a tender, juicy, medium-rare interior. By starting the roast off in a lower temperature oven, we evenly cook the meat and reduce its surface moisture, so that a finishing blast of high heat quickly gives it a perfectly burnished exterior.","Yield:Serves 3 to 12, depending on size of roast
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:4 1/2 hours to 8 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.9148936170213","Ingredients
1 standing rib roast (prime rib), 3 to 12 pounds (1.3 to 5.4kg; see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Preheat oven to lowest possible temperature setting, 150°F (66°C) or higher if necessary. (Some ovens cannot hold a temperature below 250°F/121°C.) Season roast generously with salt and pepper. Place roast, with fat cap up, on a V-rack set in a large roasting pan, or on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Place in oven and cook until center of roast registers 120-125°F (49-52°C) on an instant-read thermometer for rare, 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, or 135°F (57°C) for medium to medium-well. In a 150°F oven, this will take around 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours; in a 250°F oven, this will take 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
2.
Remove roast from oven and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Place in a warm spot in the kitchen and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to highest possible temperature setting, 500 to 550°F (260 to 288°C).
3.
Ten minutes before guests are ready to be served, remove foil, place roast back in hot oven, and cook until well browned and crisp on the exterior, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, carve, and serve immediately.

Rated: 4.1111111111111","Ingredients
4 pounds (1.8kg) moist sweet potatoes, such as ruby or garnet yams (about 4 large potatoes; see note)
8 sprigs thyme, divided
6 tablespoons butter (3 ounces; 85g)
1/4 cup (60ml) maple syrup
Kosher salt","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position. Place 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil on a work surface. Working with 1 sheet at a time, place half of potatoes in center along with 3 sprigs of thyme. Fold up foil and crimp edges to seal tightly. Repeat with other half of potatoes. Transfer pouches to a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Set oven to 300°F (150°C). Roast until a thin skewer inserted into potatoes meets no resistance, about 2 hours. Remove potatoes from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.
2.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling gently, until particles are pale golden brown and smell nutty. Immediately transfer to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add maple syrup. Pick leaves off of remaining 2 thyme sprigs, roughly chop, and add to bowl.
3.
Peel sweet potatoes and discard skins. Add flesh to bowl with butter and syrup. Beat with whisk attachment or a handheld mixer until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Serve. See note for make-ahead suggestions.

Yeasted Pumpkin Bread Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Beneath its colorful facade, this soft and chewy bread is nothing more than a white sandwich loaf with pumpkin purée taking the place of water in the dough. The purée lends a subtle earthiness to the bread, one that's mellow enough to keep the overall profile classic and mild. It's a versatile loaf that will add seasonal flair to any meal, whether you toast it up in the mornings to serve with butter and jam, slice it thin for grilled cheese, turn thick slabs into French toast, cube it into bread pudding, or tear it up for your favorite holiday stuffing.","Yield:One 8-inch loaf
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:About 6 hours
Rated: 4.9130434782609","Ingredients
16 ounces bread flour (about 3 1/2 cups, spooned; 455g)
2 1/4 teaspoons (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 ounce instant dry yeast, such as SAF (about 2 teaspoons; 7g yeast); not RapidRise or active dry (more info here)
12 ounces pumpkin purée, canned or homemade (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)
2 ounces pure maple syrup (a shy 1/4 cup; 55g)
2 ounces unsalted butter, melted (about 4 tablespoons; 55g), or 1 1/2 ounces neutral oil or roasted pumpkin seed oil (about 3 tablespoons; 42g)","1.
Making the Dough: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the bread flour, salt, and instant yeast together to combine. Add pumpkin purée, maple syrup, and melted butter (or oil), and process until the dough comes together in a smooth, pliable ball; the timing can vary depending on the size and power of a given food processor, but expect about 75 seconds from start to finish. To test the dough, tear off a small piece and stretch gently in all directions; when the dough is ready, it can be pulled into a thin, translucent sheet.
2.
Proofing the Dough: Lightly grease a medium bowl, then add the dough. Cover and proof at room temperature until doubled in bulk. This will take about 2 hours at around 72°F; the process will move faster at warmer temperatures, and slower when it is cool. To test the dough, poke it gently with a flour-dusted fingertip; when the dough is ready, it will retain a shallow impression that springs back after a few minutes. If the dough is firm and springs back right away, continue proofing until the dough retains a shallow impression.
3.
Shaping the Dough: Turn the dough onto a work surface with just the barest sprinkling of flour, and knead for a few seconds to deflate; this creates a more uniform crumb in the loaf by eliminating large pockets of air. Pat the dough into a 7-inch square, and form into a tight log, sealing the dough together with your heel. Nestle into a lightly greased loaf pan, seam side down, then cover and proof as before (for dinner rolls, see note on shaping below). The dough will be ready when it's puffy and light, and risen about 2 inches above the rim of the pan. This will take about 2 hours at around 72°F; the process will move faster at warmer temperatures, and slower when it is cool; the dough's readiness can be tested as before. Near the end of this period, adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat to 350°F.
4.
When the dough is ready, uncover and bake until well-risen, golden brown, and hollow sounding when thumped; about 45 minutes, or to an internal temperature of approximately 205°F. Immediately turn the loaf out onto a wire rack, and cool completely before slicing. The loaf will keep up to a week at room temperature in a bread box or paper bag.

Modern Baked Mac and Cheese With Cheddar and Gruyère Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
This baked macaroni and cheese recipe harnesses the amazing emulsifying powers of sodium citrate, the same salt used to make American cheese so incredibly meltable. Simply blend the grated cheese of your choice (we use cheddar) into water that has sodium citrate dissolved into it, and the gooiest, smoothest, and silkiest cheese sauce emerges. Then just toss it with your pasta and some more cheese, top with buttery bread crumbs, and bake. Baked mac and cheese can't get any easier than this.","Yield:Makes one 9- by 13-inch baking dish, serving 8
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes

1 pound (450g) elbow macaroni
5 tablespoons (75g) unsalted butter, divided
4 teaspoons (20g) sodium citrate (see note)
1 1/2 pounds (680g) grated sharp cheddar cheese (see note)
1 teaspoon (5ml) hot sauce, such as Frank's RedHot
1/2 teaspoon (2g) mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon (1g) garlic powder
1/2 pound (225g) grated Gruyère cheese (see note)
1 cup panko bread crumbs (2 ounces; 55g)","1.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook elbow macaroni until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter until butter is melted and pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.
2.
In a large saucepan, bring 3 cups (720ml) water to a simmer. Whisk in sodium citrate until fully dissolved. While maintaining a gentle simmer, add cheddar cheese in small increments, using an immersion blender to incorporate it completely into the sauce before the next addition. When all the cheese is added and the sauce is smooth and glossy, blend in hot sauce, mustard powder, and garlic powder. Season with salt, if necessary.
3.
Scrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly, then add grated Gruyère and mix well. Scrape pasta into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and smooth surface into an even layer.
4.
Add panko to a small mixing bowl. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter, then add to panko and mix until evenly coated. Season with salt. Scatter panko all over surface of mac and cheese in an even layer. Bake on top rack of oven until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can vary; check often to prevent top from burning).
5.
Let mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then serve. Leftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave or oven.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer porcini to a cutting board and roughly chop. Add fresh mushroom scraps to container with porcini-infused stock and set aside.
2.
Heat olive oil and butter in the base of a pressure cooker over high heat, swirling, until foaming subsides. Add fresh mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until excess moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are well browned, about 8 minutes.
3.
Add onion, garlic, and chopped porcini (if using) and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.) Stir in soy sauce and miso paste until evenly incorporated.
4.
Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes.
5.
Pour stock into pot through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding mushroom stems. Scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker, either by running it under cold water if it is not electric or using the steam-release valve if it is electric.
6.
Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; a creamy consistency should begin to develop. Stir in cream (if using), cheese, and herbs. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more. If it is too thick, stir in some hot water. It should flow slowly when you drag a trail through it with a spoon. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately on hot plates, passing extra cheese at the table.

A pinch of nutmeg and a sprinkling of salt amplify the butterscotch-y flavor of these chocolate chip cookies, while a blend of milk and dark chocolate chunks provides alternating bites of creamy sweetness and bitter intensity. You can bake the cookies until they're golden brown and crunchy, but I prefer to pull them while they're still a wee bit pale so they stay soft and fudgy, crisp only around the very edges.
Though these chocolate chip cookies are best enjoyed warm, they can be kept for up to two days in an airtight container at room temperature.

Ultra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji López-Alt. Video: Vicky Wasik]
The key to super-fluffy mashed potatoes is to remove as much starch from the spuds as possible. We accomplish this by peeling and dicing them before rinsing them in water and boiling them just until cooked. After cooking, they get a final rinse before heading to the ricer. Using a ricer or food mill prevents excess damage to the starch granules, helping the potatoes remain nice and light.

"Classic, Savory Shepherd's Pie (With Beef and/or Lamb) Recipe",,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Shepherd's pie, the British casserole of minced meat and vegetables topped with buttery mashed potatoes, delivers perfection in every bite. This version features extra-rich and creamy mashed potatoes and a hearty, carrot- and pea-studded meat sauce, made ever so slightly in the style of a classic Italian ragù.","Yield:Serves 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:About 2 hours
Rated: 4.2857142857143","Ingredients
For the Mashed Potatoes:
3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg) russet potatoes (about 4 large), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
Kosher salt
6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cubed
For the Meat Sauce:
1 1/2 cups (360ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 packets unflavored gelatin (about 5 teaspoons; 1/2 ounce; 14g)
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil
2 1/2 pounds (1kg) ground beef or lamb, or some combination (see note)
1 large yellow onion (about 14 ounces; 400g), diced
3 medium carrots (about 8 ounces; 225g), diced
2 ribs celery (about 4 ounces; 110g), diced
2 medium cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste
1 cup (240ml) dry red wine
2 sprigs thyme
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon (15ml) Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon (5ml) Marmite (optional)
2 tablespoons (15g) all-purpose flour
8 ounces (225g) frozen peas
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
To Assemble:
1 1/2 cups (360ml) heavy cream
Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for topping (optional)","1.
For the Mashed Potatoes: Set cubed potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water until water runs clear. Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 2 inches. Season water with salt until almost as salty as the sea. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl.
2.
Using a potato masher, food mill, or ricer, mash potatoes with butter. Press surface smooth, then press plastic wrap directly against surface to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside until ready to assemble.
3.
Meanwhile, for the Meat Sauce: Place stock in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside.
4.
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add half of ground meat and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes; use a potato masher or large whisk to break up meat. Add remaining meat and cook, breaking up with masher or whisk, until reduced to small bits, about 3 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent scorching. If meat has rendered an excessive amount of fat, use a metal spoon to ladle most of it out, leaving just a few tablespoons in the pot. Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until just beginning to soften slightly, about 4 minutes.
5.
Add tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add red wine and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until almost fully evaporated. Add reserved chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf, Worcestershire, and Marmite, if using. Sprinkle flour over ground meat in pot, then stir in. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is reduced and thick, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Stir in peas and season with salt and pepper.
6.
To Assemble and Bake: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Before assembling, heat cream in a large saucepan until simmering. Add potatoes and stir gently until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Potatoes are now ready for assembly.
7.
Set a 9- by 13-inch baking dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Add meat sauce, being careful not to fill more than halfway. (You might not need all of the sauce, depending on the exact size of your baking dish.) Top with mashed potatoes, spreading them with a spatula to cover surface completely. Using spatula, create a dappled pattern on top of potatoes. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if using.
8.
Transfer to oven and bake until top is browned and casserole is fully heated through, about 20 minutes. For deeper browning, place casserole on a rack set about 6 inches under a hot broiler for the last few moments of cooking. (Monitor closely to prevent potatoes from burning.)
9.
Let stand 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Casserole can be assembled, wrapped with plastic, and refrigerated up to 2 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven for about 35 minutes, then use broiler to brown top.

This is a supremely low-key approach to apple pie: no precooking the apples or reducing their ""juices"" (a misnomer, because the liquid is predominantly dissolved sugar) on the stove. This method involves simply macerating the apples in brown sugar and spices until they're ultra-tender, then tossing in a little tapioca starch just before assembling the pie. It's baked relatively low and slow, giving the crust time to turn golden and crisp without overcooking the apples, which turn to mush at temperatures above 195°F (91°C). The result is an easy apple pie that slices like a dream, with a thick but saucy filling.

Active time: 1 hour
Total time:5 hours
Rated: 4.7058823529412","Ingredients
For the Filling:
8 ounces light brown sugar (1 cup, packed; 225g)
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt (see note); for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
4 1/4 pounds tart apples (about 8 large apples; 1.9kg), such as Granny Smith (see note)
1 ounce tapioca starch (1/4 cup, spooned; 25g), such as Bob's Red Mill
Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, rolled and chilled per directions for a double crust
For the Egg Wash:
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1/2 ounce heavy cream (1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
For the Filling: Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a gallon-sized zip-top bag (do not add tapioca at this time). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.
2.
Measure 50 ounces sliced apples (11 rounded cups; 1.45kg) into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost a third of their volume, at least 3 hours. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.
3.
Add tapioca starch to the apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Pour apple filling into the prepared pie shell, nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).
4.
For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, yolk, cream, and salt together in a small bowl, then brush over the chilled pie. With a sharp knife, cut six 3-inch vents around the top, wiggling the blade left and right to open each into a wide vent.
5.
To Bake: Place pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan and bake until 195°F (91°C) in the very center, about 75 minutes. This is easiest to monitor with an in-oven digital thermometer, which can be programmed to chime on reaching the target temperature.
6.
To Serve: Cool at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature. Warm in a 350°F (180°C) oven to restore the crispy crust and saucy filling.

Short of a box mix, the cream biscuit is by far the simplest biscuit formula out there. Dry ingredients are whisked together and heavy cream is gently stirred in. That's it. In fact, the biscuit dough will probably be ready before your oven has fully preheated. But don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe—it might not contain any butter, but heavy cream is full of butterfat that makes the biscuits light and tender with a rich, milky flavor.
Why this recipe works:
Heavy cream provides rich butterfat that gives the biscuits tenderness and flavor, as well as moisture from its water content.
The formula requires minimal mixing, reducing the risk of too much gluten development.","Yield:Makes about 12 biscuits

The basic ratios of my cheesecake are in line with a recipe published in New York City over one hundred years ago, but with a portion of the cream cheese replaced by goat cheese. That combination mimics the texture of old fashioned cream cheese—tangy, fresh, and a little crumbly too. It makes for a cheesecake that tastes perfectly authentic, not goaty, and free from the gumminess that can plague some recipes. Thanks to an initial burst of high heat, it puffs gently in the oven, creating a uniquely light but creamy consistency.

Active time: About 1 hour
Total time:About 13 hours

For the Graham Cracker Crust:
7 ounces graham cracker crumbs, store-bought or homemade, see note (about 1 3/4 cups; 200g)
1 ounce unsalted butter, melted (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)
Pinch of salt
For the Cheesecake:
32 ounces full-fat cream cheese, such as Philadelphia, brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 4 cups; 905g)
8 ounces fresh goat cheese (not pre-crumbled), brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 1 cup; 225g)
1/2 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)

6 large eggs (about 10 1/2 ounces; 300g)
6 ounces heavy cream (about 3/4 cup; 170g)
To Serve:
16 ounces (volume will vary; 455g) fresh fruit, such as pitted and halved cherries, blueberries, sliced peaches, small strawberries, or some assortment thereof, optional
1 recipe (about 1/2 cup) complementary Fruit Syrup or jelly, for saucing the fruit, optional","1.
Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch non-reactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style; this style can be difficult to find, but this pan was manufactured especially for this recipe. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.
2.
If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan.
3.
For the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.
4.
For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450°F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
5.
Reduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.
6.
In a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking.
7.
Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250°F until done; this may take an hour or more.
8.
Turn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250°F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145°F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.
9.
Let the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.
10.
Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.
11.
Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.
12.
To Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional). Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice. Top with spoonfuls of the sauced fruit, if using, or other toppings and sauces as desired.

These crispy cookies are rich and aromatic thanks to the floral character of Ceylon cinnamon and the deeply caramelized sweetness of well-toasted sugar or Belgian-style brown sugar, sometimes called candi sugar or cassonade—accept no substitutions! The spice blend is subtle, but vital to capturing the gentle spiciness of the real deal, so be sure to use level measurements or else bust out a microscale if you have one.

Turn the dough onto a clean surface, and knead gently to form a ball. Pat into a rectangular shape, then dust with flour, above and below. Roll to a thickness of 3/16-inch, using a ruler for guidance. Slide an offset spatula beneath the dough to loosen, and brush away the excess flour.
4.
With a fluted pastry wheel, cut the dough into 3/4-inch strips, then cut crossways to form 2-inch rectangles. With the offset spatula, transfer the cutouts and scraps to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving an inch between each piece to account for spread.
5.
Bake until cookies are golden brown, about 16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through if needed to ensure even browning. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the cookies will not crisp until fully cool. Enjoy with coffee, and store leftovers in an airtight container up to 1 month at room temperature; the scraps can be ground to use for crumbs and frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months.

The Best Sweet Potato Biscuits Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Thick and mellow sweet potato purée makes these colorful biscuits tender, moist, and light. Despite their vibrant color, sweet potato biscuits have a buttery flavor that's as classic as they come—perfect to serve alongside hearty soups and stews, or with a simple spoonful of blueberry jam.","Yield:Makes about 14 two-inch biscuits
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 4.875","Ingredients
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 ounces cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2"" cubes (about 8 tablespoons; 110g)
9 ounces sweet potato purée, from one large sweet potato, see note (about 1 heaping cup; 255g)
3 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 85g)","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F. Should your kitchen be warmer than 75°F, please see our guide to baking in a hot kitchen before getting started; the specifics are focused on pie dough, but the overall principles are true of biscuits as well.
2.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl, then whisk until well combined (this may take up to 1 minute). Add the butter, toss to break up the pieces, and smash each cube flat. Continue smashing and rubbing until the butter has mostly disappeared into a floury mix, although a few larger, Cheerio-sized pieces may remain. This can also be done with 4 or 5 pulses in a food processor, just take care not to overdo it. The prepared mix can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks in an airtight container, then used as directed below.
3.
Mash the sweet potato purée and milk together with a fork, or combine with an immersion blender until perfectly smooth. Add to the dry mix in a large bowl, and fold with a flexible spatula until fully absorbed. The dough will seem rather crumbly and dry at first, but keep mixing until it finally comes together. Once the dough forms a rough ball, turn out onto a lightly floured surface.
4.
With your bare hands, gently pat the dough into a squarish shape about 1/2-inch thick, then fold in half; repeat twice more for a total of 3 folds, using only enough flour to keep your hands from sticking. Finish by patting the dough to a thickness of 3/4 inch. If needed, dust away any excess flour, then cut into 1 3/4-inch rounds and arrange in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Gather scraps into a ball, pat and fold a single time, then cut as many more biscuits as you can. The final round of scraps can be gathered and shaped into a single biscuit by hand.
5.
Bake until the biscuits are well-risen and golden brown, about 25 minutes (or longer if cut thicker than 3/4-inch). Let the biscuits cool about 5 minutes to help set their crumb, then serve as desired, whether alongside soups and stews or split for shortcake or breakfast sandwiches. Leftovers can be stored up to a week in an airtight container; to serve, split the stale biscuits in half, brush with melted butter, arrange on a baking sheet, and broil until golden brown, then serve with jam.

","[Video: The Serious Eats Team; Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Duck à l'orange is a classic French recipe featuring a whole roasted duck with crispy, crackling skin along with an aromatic sweet-sour sauce known as sauce bigarade. The original sauce bigarade is made with bitter oranges (sometimes called bigarade oranges, sour oranges, or Seville oranges), and it's finely balanced, with just enough sweetness to offset the intensity of those oranges. Many recipes that call for substituting navel oranges and lemons get the balance wrong, falling too far to the cloyingly sweet side, but this recipe is designed to mirror the original sauce more faithfully (it also works with bitter oranges, if you can find them). The result is complex, fragrant, and lip-smackingly delicious, with a fine-tuned sauce that cuts right through the rich fattiness of the duck.
One whole duck has enough meat for two hungry diners or four less famished ones. If you are serving more people, consider doubling the recipe (you will need to double everything except the gastrique, of which this recipe produces more than enough).","Yield:Serves 2 to 4 as a main course
Active time: 5 hours
Total time:6 hours plus optional overnight dry-brining
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 whole duck (about 5 pounds; 2.25kg)
Vegetable oil, for drizzling
Kosher salt
1 medium carrot, diced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 large celery rib, diced
2 quarts (2 liters) brown beef or brown chicken stock (see note)
1 tablespoon (15ml) tomato paste (optional)
4 ounces (115g) granulated sugar (about 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon)
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
Zest of 1 navel orange or 2 bitter oranges, cleaned of any white pith and cut into a fine julienne
2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh navel orange juice or 1/4 cup (60ml) bitter orange juice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (omit if using bitter orange juice)
Freshly ground white or black pepper
2 tablespoons (30g) cold unsalted butter
Cornstarch or arrowroot (optional, only if needed)","1.
If desired, you can spatchcock the duck (see note). To do so, use poultry shears to remove the backbone by cutting along both sides of the spine from the cavity to neck ends, then flip the duck and press down on the breast to flatten it.
2.
Trim away any excess skin around the duck's neck and cavity openings. Cut off duck wingettes and wing tips at the joint, leaving the drumettes connected to the duck; remove neck and any giblets from the cavity. Refrigerate trimmed wing ends, neck, and spine (if using) until ready to make the sauce; reserve giblets and trimmed skin for another use, or discard.
3.
Prick duck skin all over with a sharp paring knife, especially where the skin is thickest, being careful not to cut into the meat below. In a large pot of boiling water and while wearing heavy kitchen gloves to protect your hands from the heat, dip the duck into the water for 2 minutes. Remove, allowing boiling water to drain off before transferring duck, breast side up, to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.
4.
Season duck all over, inside and out, with kosher salt. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
5.
When ready to roast the duck and make the sauce, preheat oven to 425°F (220°C) and set rack in middle position. Set trimmed wings and neck (plus backbone, if you've spatchcocked the duck) on a rimmed baking sheet along with the diced carrot, onion, and celery and drizzle lightly with oil, rubbing to coat all over; if using tomato paste (it will help darken an overly white stock), rub it all over the duck and vegetables as well.
6.
Roast duck trimmings and vegetables, stirring one or twice, until browned all over, about 25 minutes (check often, as you do not want anything to scorch or burn).
7.
Add stock to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Transfer roasted duck trimmings and vegetables to the stock. Pour some boiling water onto the baking sheet and scrape up any browned bits, then add that liquid to the stock, as well.
8.
Gently simmer stock and vegetables until reduced by about half, about 2 hours (timing can vary wildly as evaporation rates depend on the pot dimensions and other factors, so keep an eye on it); occasionally skim off and discard any scum or rendered fat that accumulates on the surface.
9.
Fine-strain stock and discard solids. Add stock to a smaller saucepan and continue to gently simmer until reduced to about 1 cup (225ml); continue to occasionally skim off any scum. Set aside.
10.
Meanwhile, increase oven to 450°F (230°C). Roast duck (you can leave it on the wire rack set in the rimmed baking sheet) for 30 minutes; this can produce some smoke, so open your windows if necessary.
11.
Reduce oven to 300°F (150°C) and continue to roast duck until an instant-read thermometer registers around 175°F in the thickest parts of the thigh and breast, about 45 minutes if the duck is spatchcocked and 1 hour if whole (it's okay if some parts of the duck get hotter, it's meant to be well done and will not harm the duck). Remove duck from oven and set aside to rest.
12.
While duck is roasting, add sugar to a small saucepan. Add 1/4 cup water and set over medium heat. Stir with a fork until syrup comes to a boil, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey-colored, roughly 6 minutes, shaking and swirling as needed to ensure even caramelization. Continue cooking until syrup is a rich mahogany color, about 4 minutes longer.
13.
Remove from heat and add vinegar in very small increments while carefully swirling the saucepan; the caramel will boil and bubble violently at first, so adding the vinegar in very small amounts at first will help prevent a boil-over. Once the gastrique has calmed down, you can add the remaining vinegar more quickly, swirling the whole time. Some of the caramel may seize up at first, but it will dissolve back into the solution on its own.
14.
Return gastrique to medium heat and bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a strong simmer and cook until it is very slightly reduced, about 2 minutes; stir, if needed, to dissolve any last traces of hardened sugar, then set aside.
15.
In a clean small saucepan, bring about 1 cup of water to a rolling boil. Add orange zest and cook until softened, about 2 minutes for navel orange zest and 15 minutes for bitter orange zest. Drain and set blanched zest aside.
16.
When ready to serve, return duck to oven just long enough to reheat and re-crisp the skin, 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how much it's cooled off.
17.
Meanwhile, add navel orange and lemon juices (or bitter orange juice) to reduced stock and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently until reduced enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
18.
Add gastrique 1 teaspoon at a time until sauce tastes nicely sharp with a clear sweet-sour character. You want to taste the gastrique but not have it clobber the sauce; too much can ruin the sauce (you may only need a 2 to 4 teaspoons to accomplish this). You will have leftover gastrique, which you can reserve for another use (it can be drizzled on grilled or roasted vegetables or used in another sauce).
19.
Season sauce with salt and pepper. Working over very low heat, whisk in butter until the sauce is silky and smooth; do not allow it to boil once the butter is added, lest the sauce break.
20.
The sauce at this point should lightly coat the back of a spoon, and if you drag your finger through it, it should leave a clear path. If it doesn't, it may be too thin (a sign your stock didn't have enough gelatin in it originally). If this happens, add 1 or 2 teaspoons cornstarch or arrowroot to a small bowl and stir in a spoonful or two of the sauce to make a slurry with no lumps, then whisk that slurry back into the sauce, allowing it to gently simmer for a minute or two to thicken the sauce.
21.
Add blanched zest and let very gently simmer for 1 minute to infuse into the sauce.
22.
Carve duck and serve, spooning sauce on top or alongside.

As Nabisco likes to remind us, Fig Newtons aren't just cookies: they're fruit and cake. True to that legacy, my homemade version pairs an easy, no-cook fig preserve with a soft dough inspired by yellow cake. Since everything hinges on the concentrated jammy flavor of dried figs, it's vital that you love their taste straight from the bag, so look for brands that are plump, moist, and naturally sweet. I dig Trader Joe's, having found other national brands disappointingly bland.

Cakey Cookie Dough:
10 1/2 ounces all purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting (2 1/4 cups, spooned; 295g)
5 ounces unsalted butter, soft but cool, about 65°F (1 1/4 sticks; 140g)
4 ounces light brown sugar, gently packed (1/2 cup; 110g)
1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon (3.6g) baking soda
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 ounce honey (about 2 tablespoons, ungreased; 30g)
1 teaspoon orange zest
1/2 ounce freshly squeezed orange juice (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
3 large egg yolks, straight from the fridge (approximately 1 1/2 ounces; 40g)
No-Cook Fig Preserves:
12 ounces plump, sticky dried Mission figs, stems trimmed (about 2 1/2 cups; 340g)
3 1/2 ounces sweetened or unsweetened applesauce (about 1/3 cup; 100g)
1 ounce freshly squeezed orange juice (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)","1.
Prepare the Dough: Combine butter, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, honey, and orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add orange juice, then add the egg yolks one at a time and continue beating until smooth. Reduce the speed to low and sprinkle in the flour, mixing until well combined.
2.
Knead the dough against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball. Flatten into a disc and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until cool and firm but not hard, about 1 hour. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature.)
3.
Prepare the Preserves: Cut the figs in half. Pulse with applesauce and orange juice in a food processor until roughly chopped, then process to a thick, smooth paste. Scrape the bowl and blade with a flexible spatula, then process a minute more to ensure absolutely no chunks remain. Transfer to a sturdy piping bag fitted with a 1⁄2-inch plain tip and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours. (The preserves can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.)
4.
To Assemble the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Knead the cool dough on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth, then dust with flour and roll into an 8-inch square. Sprinkle both sides with flour and roll into a 15-inch square. Slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen it, brush off excess flour, and cut into four 3 1/4-inch strips.
5.
Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle just above the surface of the dough (this will force the preserves to flatten as they leave the bag), pipe a 1-inch-wide strip down the center of each portion. Fold a long flap of dough over each strip, brush away excess flour, and roll each bar over, seam side down. Gently flatten each bar with your fingertips, then transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan (all four bars will fit on a single sheet).
6.
Bake until the bars are puffed and firm, without any significant browning, about 18 minutes. Immediately cut into 1-inch pieces with a bench scraper, then transfer to an airtight container, with a paper towel between each layer and on top. This will steam the cookies and retain moisture for them to reabsorb, creating a uniquely soft and cakey texture. Cover and “mature” for at least 6 hours before serving; prior to that, the cookies will taste dry. Store for up to 1 week at room temperature or up to a month in the fridge.

Ladyfingers don't taste like much on their own, just tender-crisp bites of dry sponge cake, but when homemade they're an extraordinary touch in everything from banana pudding to tiramisu. A bit of lemon zest in the batter make them aromatic and bright, but not outright lemony—feel free to omit it if you prefer.","Yield:Makes about thirty 3 1/4-inch fingers
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 3.875","Ingredients
3 large eggs (about 5 1/2 ounces; 155g)
4 3/4 ounces sugar (about 2/3 cup; 135g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 ounce freshly grated lemon zest (about 1 tablespoon; 7g) from 1 large lemon, optional
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)
1/2 ounce cornstarch (about 2 tablespoons; 15g)
Powdered sugar, for dusting","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line two half sheet pans with parchment and fit a large piping bag with a 1/2-inch round tip. Roll bag open and stand upright in a tall drinking glass so it can be filled hands-free (full piping bag tutorial here). Have ready a small, fine-mesh sieve of powdered sugar for dusting. Fill a 2- or 3-quart saucier with a few inches of water; bring to a boil, then lower heat and adjust to maintain a steady supply of steam.
2.
For the Ladyfingers: Combine eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer, using a flexible spatula to stir. Place over the steaming pot (if it touches the bottom, crumple a strip of foil into a ring to act as a booster seat) and cook, stirring and scraping constantly, until warmed to 160°F. This should not take significantly longer than 5 minutes; major delays simply indicate insufficient heat/lack of steam.
3.
Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until the eggs are foamy, more than quadrupled in size, and thick enough to briefly mound up like soft serve when dropped from the whisk, from 5 to 10 minutes depending on the horsepower of your mixer. This is a crucial stage; if the foam is unable to hold soft peaks, the lady fingers will spread flat in the oven.
4.
When eggs are foamy and thick enough to briefly hold their shape when dropped from the whisk, add lemon zest, if using, then sift the flour and cornstarch on top. Fold gently with a flexible spatula to combine in a thick batter. Transfer to prepared piping bag, twist to close, and pipe approximately thirty 3- by 1-inch fingers, leaving an inch between each one. When piping, hold the bag at a 45° angle and apply steady pressure as you pipe, then stop squeezing before you reach the end of each one, and lift the bag straight up to break the ""tail"" of batter.

Crispy Roasted Potatoes With Curry Leaf and Mustard Oil Mayonnaise Recipe,,"[Photograph: Nik Sharma]
Editors' Note: Nik Sharma's new book, The The Flavor Equation: The Science of Great Cooking Explained in More Than 100 Essential Recipes, comes out in October 2020. You can pre-order it anywhere books are sold.
This is a riff on Kenji's excellent recipe for roasted potatoes, with a few flavor accents that I think go very well with my curry leaf and mustard oil mayonnaise, which I developed for my book, The Flavor Equation (my mayonnaise recipe works with either extra-virgin olive oil or mustard oil that have been debittered using my hot-water technique, but I recommend using mustard oil here). For the potatoes, instead of using a flavored oil as Kenji does in his recipe, I opt for extra-virgin olive oil and toss the cooked potatoes with a savory and fragrant mix of garlic and onion powders, ground sumac, and a little chile powder for a small, spicy kick.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 15 minutes

Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda
4 pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)
5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground sumac
1 teaspoon red chile powder
Curry Leaf and Mustard Oil Mayonnaise, for serving","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F/230°C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
2.
When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to large mixing bowl, add olive oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
3.
Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
4.
Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add onion powder, garlic powder, ground sumac, and red chile powder. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately with ramekin of curry leaf and mustard mayonnaise for dipping alongside.

","The ultimate Fall-inspired casserole with squash, apple, and plenty of cheese. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Roasted squash and sage are classic fall and winter flavors. I wanted to find the best way to incorporate them into a rich, creamy lasagna. The result—after a bit of tweaking and testing, of course—was a squash lasagna with intense, rich, sweet squash flavor balanced with chunks of sage-scented browned squash and apple, all layered with a creamy Gruyère white sauce and layers of tender pasta.
Why this recipe works:
Using no-boil pasta sheets soaked in water takes a fraction of the effort of boiling traditional lasagna noodles and delivers superior results.
Slow-roasting squash enhances its sweetness and intensifies its flavor.
We incorporate squash in two ways: as a creamy purée enhanced with cream cheese, and sautéed in butter.
Sautéing cubes of apple along with the pumpkin enhances its flavor without distracting.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:2 hours 15 minutes
Rated: 4.6666666666667","Ingredients
1 large kabocha squash or sugar pumpkin (about 2 1/2 pounds), quartered, seeds discarded
1 tablespoon olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 large egg
4 ounces cream cheese
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, divided
2 crisp baking apples such as Golden Delicious, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice
1/4 cup minced fresh sage leaves
1 package no-boil lasagna noodles (15 noodles)
2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
2 tablespoons flour
2 cups whole milk
12 ounces shredded Gruyère cheese","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 325°F. Toss three squash quarters with 1 tablespoon olive oil and coat thoroughly using your hands. Season with salt and pepper. Place in a cast iron skillet or on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast until a knife meets no resistance when poked into the flesh around the stem, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle. Increase oven temperature to 400°F.
2.
Scrape roasted squash flesh out into the work bowl of a food processor. Add egg, cream cheese, 2 tablespoons butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, and half of nutmeg. Process until a completely smooth purée is formed. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside.
3.
While squashes are roasting in step 1, cut remaining squash quarter into 1/2-inch dice. Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in a large skillet over high heat, swirling until foaming subsides. Add diced squash and apple and cook, tossing and stirring frequently until tender and browned on most sides, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and add minced sage. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
4.
Place lasagna noodles in a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish and cover with cold water. Set aside, agitating the noodles occasionally to make sure they aren't sticking.
5.
Meanwehile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter and garlic in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until butter has melted and garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until flour starts to smell nutty and is pale blond, about 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly add the milk in a thin, steady stream. Once milk is fully incorporated, bring to a boil, whisk vigorously, then remove from heat. Add 8 ounces of Gruyère cheese and whisk until completely smooth. If any lumps remain, blend with a hand blender or in a standing blender until smooth. Add remaining 1/8th teaspoon nutmeg and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
6.
Remove lasagna noodles from baking dish and transfer to clean dish towels to blot excess moisture.
7.
Spread 1/6th of the white sauce over the bottom of the baking dish and top with three lasagna noodles. Add 1/5 of squash puree and 1/4 of sautéed squash and apple mixture. Top with 1/6th of white sauce. Repeat with 3 more layers of noodles, squash puree, cooked squash mixture, and white sauce. At this stage, you should have used up all of the sautéed squash and still have 1/6th of the white sauce and 1/5th of the squash purée remaining. Place the final three noodles on top of the lasagna, top with the remaining purée, the remaining 4 ounces of shredded Gruyère, and drizzle with the remaining white sauce. Cover with aluminum foil, and transfer to the oven.
8.
Bake, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until browned and bubbly, about 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let rest for 5 minutes, slice, and serve.

Lofthouse-Style Frosted Sugar Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Video.]
These homemade Lofthouse-style cookies are so light and cake-like, it's not even fair to call them cookies. They're as puffy, soft, and sweet as a vanilla cupcake, with creamy frosting and rainbow sprinkles, too. Take care when scooping the soft batter, or else you'll wind up with cookies shaped like haphazard blobs. For best results, use a cookie scoop, scraped level against the side of the bowl.","Yield:Makes 24 (3-inch) cookies
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Frosting:
10 ounces powdered sugar (2 1/2 cups; 285g)
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use the same weight or half as much by volume
2 1/2 ounces heavy cream (shy 1/3 cup; 70g)
1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract
For the Cookie Dough:
8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g), pliable but cool, about 60°F (16°C)
7 ounces sugar (1 cup; 200g)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use the same weight or half as much by volume
2 ounces egg white (1/4 cup; 55g), from about 2 large eggs
1 ounce heavy cream (2 tablespoons; 30g)
2 teaspoons (10ml) vanilla extract
11 ounces bleached cake flour (2 3/4 cups; 310g), such as Swans Down (see note)
Assorted food coloring, nonpareils, and sprinkles, for decorating (optional)","1.
For the Frosting: Combine powdered sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape frosting into a small bowl, or as many bowls as you would like colors, and cover with plastic pressed directly against the surface. Set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature.
2.
For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Using the same bowl and paddle attachment used for frosting (no need to clean), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, pale ivory, and soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg whites, cream, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup until homogeneous. With the mixer still running, add liquid mixture in 4 or 5 additions, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through. Decrease mixer to low speed, sprinkle in cake flour, and continue mixing to form a soft dough. Fold batter once or twice with a flexible spatula to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up.
3.
Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, divide dough into 24 level portions and carefully drop onto 2 parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pans, leaving 2 1/2 inches between each dough ball. If needed, pause to rinse scoop in hot water to ensure a clean release (misshapen scoops will spread into an irregular form). Bake until puffed and pale overall, but just barely golden around the very edges, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pans until no trace of warmth remains, about 15 minutes longer.
4.
To Finish: If you like, tint frosting with a drop or two of gel paste. Working with one at a time, dollop a shy tablespoon of frosting (3/8 ounce; 10g) over each cookie, spread into an even layer with a palette knife or butter knife, and top with sprinkles, if desired. Repeat with remaining cookies and enjoy immediately. Let remaining cookies stand at room temperature until frosting forms a crust, then transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer. Store up to 3 days at room temperature.

Classic Baked Macaroni and Cheese Casserole With Cheddar and Gruyère Recipe,,"Cheesy, gooey, crisp-crusted, and satisfying. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
This classic béchamel-based mac and cheese is loaded to the hilt with cheese. Not only do we pack as much cheese as we can into the sauce itself, but we then mix the cooked pasta and cheese sauce with additional grated cheese, for tiny pockets of stretchy, melty bits throughout. One of the benefits of this method is that you can get enhanced browning in the oven, especially on the bottom and sides of the baking dish, thanks to the flour and butter in the sauce.","Yield:Makes one 9- by 13-inch baking dish, serving 8

1/4 teaspoon (1g) garlic powder
1/4 pound (115g) grated Gruyère cheese (see note)
1 cup panko bread crumbs (2 ounces; 55g)","1.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook elbow macaroni until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking time indicated on package. Drain, then transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons (30g) butter until butter is melted and pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.
2.
In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons (30g) butter over medium-high heat (do not allow it to brown). Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, add milk in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly and thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.

Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to medium-low and, working in increments, whisk in cheddar cheese until a smooth, emulsified cheese sauce forms; do not let sauce come to a boil once cheese is added. Whisk in hot sauce, mustard powder, and garlic powder. Season with salt if necessary.

Scrape cheese sauce into pasta and mix until evenly coated. Let cool slightly, then add grated Gruyère and mix well. Scrape pasta into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and smooth surface into an even layer.
5.
Add panko to a small mixing bowl. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons (45g) butter, then add to panko and mix until evenly coated. Season with salt. Scatter panko all over surface of mac and cheese in an even layer. Bake on top rack of oven until browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes (ovens can vary; check often to prevent top from burning).
6.
Let mac and cheese rest 15 minutes, then serve. Leftover mac and cheese can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; it reheats surprisingly well in the microwave or oven.

15-Minute Creamy Tomato Soup (Vegan) Recipe,,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Making excellent tomato soup from scratch at home is almost as easy as simply opening a can, and the return on your minor time investment is significant.","Yield:makes 2 1/2 quarts, serving 4 to 6
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:15 minutes
Rated: 4.875","Ingredients
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater
1 small onion, finely sliced (about 1 cup)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 slices white bread, crusts removed, torn into rough 1/2-inch pieces
2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes packed in juice
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Minced chives, basil, or parsley as garnish
Toasted bread or grilled cheese for serving","1.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently until onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add bread and tomatoes. Roughly mash tomatoes with a whisk or a potato masher. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes.
2.
Transfer half of soup to the jar of a blender. Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high (be careful starting up, it can shoot out the top of the blender—open the vent and hold a kitchen towel over the lid to prevent blowout). With blender running on high, gradually trickle in half of remaining olive oil. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with remaining half of soup and olive oil. Ladle into individual serving bowls, top with minced herbs, drizzle with more olive oil, and serve with toast or grilled cheese.

","Each Thanksgiving I look forward to firing up the smoker and seeing what new turkey creation I can come up with to throw in there. So far I've done well with an apple-brine and honey-brine, but I took things to a whole new level this year with a Cajun-inspired smoked bird.
In lieu of a brine, a spicy butter and beer based liquid was injected all over this turkey, which was then coated in a rub and smoked for three hours.
While past birds have had a more subtle flavor, this one came out packing a punch. The injection left the meat juicy and heavily spiced throughout, giving it a heat that was always present, but not so strong that it overwhelmed the light smokiness.The skin was also fantastic—you'll want to eat it by itself.
With such great success—and easier and faster than brining—I've found a new method to keep my turkey experimentation going for years on end. Now if only Thanksgiving happened more often!","Yield:8-10
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:3 hours","Ingredients
For the injection
1 12-ounce bottle beer, at room temperature
1/2 cup butter, melted
6 large garlic cloves
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon Creole seasoning
1 tablespoons liquid crab boil
1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 tablespoon Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 12-14lb natural turkey, rinsed and patted dry with paper towels
For the rub
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 fist-sized chunks of apple wood or other light smoking wood","1.
To make the injection, place beer, butter, garlic, Worcestershire, Creole seasoning, liquid crab boil, hot sauce, salt, and cayenne pepper in the jar of a blender and puree until completely smooth. Using a meat injection syringe, inject mixture into meat of turkey all over with each injection spaced about 1-inch apart.
2.
To make the rub, combine paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, oregano, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a small bowl. Season turkey inside and out with rub. Fold wings under the body and tie the legs together, then brush entire turkey lightly with vegetable oil.
3.
Fire up smoker or grill to 325°F, adding smoking wood chunks when at temperature. When wood is ignited and producing smoke, place turkey in smoker or grill and smoke until an instant read thermometer registers 165°F in thickest part of the breast, about 2 to 3 hours.
4.
Remove the turkey from smoker and allow to rest, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes. Carve and serve.

Extra-Smooth Pumpkin Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The addition of cream cheese makes this version of pumpkin pie extra creamy and imparts a slightly tangy flavor. Unlike many traditional pumpkin pie recipes, there's less liquid in the filling, which helps prevent a soggy bottom crust.","Yield:Serves 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:4 hours
Rated: 3.9285714285714","Ingredients
One half recipe Easy Pie Dough
6 ounces granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree, or 15 ounces homemade pumpkin puree
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3 large eggs","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position. Place a heavy duty rimmed baking sheet on the rack and preheat oven to 425°F.
2.
Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (you can use reuse dried beans for this), transfer pie to the preheated baking sheet, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until the bottom crust is a golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely.
3.
Reduce heat to 350°F. In the bowl of a food processor, combine sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, and pulse 3 times to mix. Add the cream cheese and pulse until a homogeneous paste forms. Add the pumpkin and butter and process for 30 seconds. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then process until the mixture is completely smooth, about 30 seconds longer. Add the eggs and process until completely smooth, scraping down sides as necessary. For extra-smooth pumpkin pie, press the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer or a chinois using the back of a ladle.
4.
Pour the mixture into prepared pie shell and smooth over the top with a rubber spatula. Rap the shell firmly against the counter a few times in order to release any air bubbles. Transfer pumpkin pie to the baking sheet in the oven and bake for until the filling puffs slightly and the center only moves slightly when jiggled, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating the pumpkin pie half way through baking. Allow the pumpkin pie to cool for at least one hour before serving. The pumpkin pie may be chilled for up to two days.

Construction Gingerbread Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This recipe makes enough gingerbread to fill a half-sheet pan, so, before getting started, sit down with your template and figure out how many trays you'll need, then multiply accordingly (up to a quadruple batch, depending on the capacity of your bowl). Construction gingerbread is foremost sturdy and strong, but my version doesn't taste too shabby—crunchy and bold, with plenty of butter, brown sugar, and vanilla, so you can still enjoy nibbling on the scraps.","Yield:Makes one 15- by 11-inch sheet
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
2 ounces brown sugar (1/4 cup; 56g)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much
4 ounces light corn syrup (1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 115g) (see note)
1 1/2 ounces unsalted butter (3 tablespoons; 45g), very soft (about 72°F)
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
6 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (1 1/3 cups; 175g), plus more for dusting","1.
For the Dough: Trim a sheet of parchment paper to fit the interior of a half sheet pan. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, corn syrup, butter, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low until smooth, then sprinkle in flour and continue mixing to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Proceed immediately, or wrap in plastic and set aside at room temperature until needed, up to 24 hours. (Larger batches should be divided into 14-ounce portions.)
2.
Sprinkle prepared parchment with flour, place dough on top, and flatten into a rectangle. Sprinkle with more flour and roll to fit just within edges of parchment, leaving dough about 3/16 inch thick. Using both hands, transfer parchment to a half sheet pan. Cut according to your gingerbread house template, using an X-Acto or paring knife. Leave a narrow border of dough around cutouts to minimize spreading, but trim away larger areas of excess dough to gather and re-roll, or turn into paste (see directions below).
3.
Bake gingerbread until dry to the touch and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Immediately cut along pre-scored lines with a sharp knife or pizza wheel. Cool completely in pan, then transfer cutouts to a safe place. Scraps can be nibbled, or ground in a food processor to use in recipes that call for cookie crumbs.
4.
For the Paste: Return scraps to mixing bowl and resume mixing on low speed. Begin adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until scraps form a stiff but pipeable paste. Thoroughly scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula to eliminate lumps, then continue mixing until perfectly smooth. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe designs, such as fences and railing, onto a parchment-lined half sheet pan and bake until pale gold, about 12 minutes. Cool completely before handling. If you like, assemble with Sturdy Royal Icing.

2 to 6 anchovies (see note)
1 teaspoon (5ml) Worcestershire sauce (see note)
1/3 cup (80ml) canola oil
2 heads romaine lettuce, inner leaves only, washed and carefully dried, large leaves torn into smaller pieces, smaller leaves left intact","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil with minced garlic and whisk for 30 seconds. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible, leaving garlic behind. Reserve pressed garlic separately. Add bread cubes to garlic oil and toss to coat. Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss again. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until croutons are pale golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons Parmesan. Allow to cool.
2.
While croutons bake, make the dressing. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, pressed garlic, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the bottom of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender or in the bottom of a food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste generously with salt and pepper.
3.
To serve, toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of dressing, adding more if desired. Once lettuce is coated, add half of remaining cheese and three-quarters of croutons and toss again. Transfer to a salad bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese and croutons. Serve.

The Best Roasted Sweet Potatoes Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Video]
The trick to creamy and flavorful sweet potatoes with a slightly crisp, caramelized crust is par-cooking the potatoes at the right temperature, which converts their starches into sweet maltose. Then we roast them in the oven for just under an hour for tender, extra-sweet wedges. Tossed in olive oil, parsley, and a bit of honey, they're a crowd-pleasing side for any wintertime meal.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8

The problem with most marshmallow-topped sweet potato casseroles is that they're far too sweet, with candied sweet potatoes layered high with sugary melted marshmallows. This version corrects that by adding savory notes to the sweet potatoes, like peppery grated ginger, nutty brown butter, woodsy herbs, and just a touch of tangy dairy. That means you can go heavy on the marshmallows without your teeth quitting in protest.

1/2 cup sour cream
10 ounces (2 cups) all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pats, plus 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter for brushing","1.
Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 425°F. Whisk together the buttermilk and sour cream in a small bowl.
2.
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until blended, about 2 seconds. Scatter the cold butter evenly over the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal and the largest butter pieces are about 1/4 inch at their widest. Transfer to a large bowl.
3.
Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until it just comes together, adding extra flour as necessary.
4.
With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch square. Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the dough over the center, then fold the left third over so you end up with a 12-by-4-inch rectangle. Fold the top third down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 4-inch square. Press the square down and roll it out again into a 12-inch square. Repeat the folding process once more. (See note for Cheddar Cheese and Scallion variation.)
5.
Roll the dough again into a 12-inch square. Cut six 4-inch rounds out of the dough with a floured biscuit cutter. Transfer the rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Form the dough scraps into a ball and knead gently 2 or 3 times, until smooth. Roll the dough out until it’s large enough to cut out 2 more 4-inch rounds, and transfer to the baking sheet.
6.
Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter and bake until golden brown and well risen, about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.

Light brown sugar gives these soft and chewy cookies their delicate molasses flavor. By using melted butter, the cookies become extra dense, while also making this a quick one-bowl recipe—no stand mixer required! Each cookie is also rolled into bonus brown sugar, so they bake up with a simmering and crackly crust.","Yield:Makes 14 to 16 cookies

This apple pie slices cleanly and holds its shape as you lift it out of the pie plate. It has chunks of apple that are tender yet intact, lightly bound in a thickened sauce that's just sweet enough, with a hint of spice. This is the pie for all you gooey-pie-lovers out there (and you know who you are).

5 pounds (2.25kg) apples (see note), peeled, cored, and sliced 1/2 inch thick
1/2 to 3/4 cup (100 to 150g) sugar (see note), plus more for sprinkling
2 tablespoons cornstarch (1/2 ounce; 15g)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons (10ml) fresh juice and 1 teaspoon grated zest from 1 lemon
1 recipe Easy Pie Dough
1 egg white","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and place a heavy rimmed baking sheet on it. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss apple slices with sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and lemon juice and zest until well coated. Let rest for 10 minutes.
2.
To Cook Filling on the Stovetop: Transfer apples and their juices to a large Dutch oven. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until lightly steaming. Cover and continue cooking over lowest heat setting, stirring frequently, using a thermometer to maintain temperature below 160°F (71°C). Do not allow liquid to come to a boil for first 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until juices thicken enough that a spatula dragged through the bottom of the pot leaves a trail that very slowly closes back up, about 10 minutes more. Transfer apples to a rimmed baking sheet, spread out into a single layer, and allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.
3.
To Cook Filling With a Sous Vide Precision Cooker (see note): Set precision cooker to 160°F (71°C). Transfer apples and their juices to a vacuum bag and seal. Cook in water bath for 1 hour. Transfer contents to a large Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until juices thicken enough that a spatula dragged through the bottom of the pot leaves a trail that very slowly closes back up, about 10 minutes. Transfer apples to a rimmed baking sheet, spread out into a single layer, and allow to cool completely, about 1 hour.
4.
Roll 1 disk of pie dough into a circle roughly 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Add filling, piling it into the pie shell until it all fits. Roll remaining disk of pie dough into a circle roughly 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to top of pie.
5.
Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim edges of both pie crusts until they overhang the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 inch all the way around. Fold edges of both pie crusts down together, tucking them in between the bottom crust and the pie plate and working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. Cut 5 slits in the top with a sharp knife for ventilation.
6.
Use a pastry brush to brush an even coat of lightly beaten egg white all over the top surface of the pie. Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon (15g) of sugar. Transfer pie to baking sheet in oven and bake until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking until deep golden brown, about 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature for at least 4 hours before serving.

Easy Roasted Brussels Sprouts Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji López-Alt. Video: Serious Eats Video]
The key to roasting Brussels sprouts is to use the full-on, frontal-assault, no-prisoners-taken, blast-the-sh*t-out-of-'em approach, a.k.a. very high heat. This allows the exteriors of the sprouts to caramelize and brown, producing sweet by-products, while at the same time making sure that they don't have enough time to develop the really sulfurous aromas that slower cooking can yield.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6

","The flavors of fall are in full force in this butternut squash risotto. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Video]
With the help of a pressure cooker, risotto becomes an insanely easy and hands-off dish. Here, it's loaded with layer upon layer of the flavors of fall: butternut squash, sage, brown butter, and just a hint of apple and maple syrup to round it out.","Yield:Serves 4
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 4.5","Ingredients
3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg) butternut squash, peeled and seeded
6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
3 medium cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 Golden Delicious apple, peeled and cored
Pinch red pepper flakes
2 sprigs sage plus 8 sage leaves, divided
Kosher salt
2 tablespoons (30ml) maple syrup
1 teaspoon (5ml) white or yellow miso
3 3/4 cups (900ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium vegetable broth, divided
1 medium yellow onion, minced
2 cups (400g) risotto rice, such as arborio
1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine
4 tablespoons (55g) unsalted butter
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for grating","1.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut about half the squash into 1-inch chunks, to yield 4 cups. Cut remaining squash into 1/4-inch dice. In a large mixing bowl, toss large squash chunks with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, garlic, apple, red pepper flakes, sage sprigs, and a large pinch of salt until evenly coated, then spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. In a separate bowl, toss small diced squash with 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt, then spread in an even layer on a second rimmed baking sheet.
2.
Bake both trays of squash, stirring once or twice during baking, until large chunks are very tender, about 45 minutes, and small diced squash is browned in spots, about 30 minutes. Discard sage sprigs from large squash chunks.
3.
Transfer large squash chunks, apple, and garlic cloves to a food processor, blender, or the container of a stick blender. Add miso and 1/4 cup (60ml) broth and blend until a smooth purée forms. Season with salt.
4.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent but not browned, about 4 minutes.
5.
Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. (Rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center.)
6.
Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine has almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes.
7.
Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups (840ml) broth; scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 5 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric.
8.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining 8 sage leaves and fry, gently swirling, until milk solids in butter turn a hazelnut-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage leaves to a paper towel–lined plate.
9.
Open pressure cooker and stir to combine rice and cooking liquid; it should begin to develop a creamy consistency. Stir in squash purée.
10.
Stir in brown butter. If risotto is too soupy, cook for a few minutes longer, stirring, until it begins to thicken more; it should look like a smooth, creamy sauce.
11.
Stir in a generous grating of Parmesan cheese, followed by the maple-roasted diced squash. Season with salt. Spoon risotto onto plates, top with fried sage leaves and more grated cheese, and serve.

2/3 cup mayonnaise, preferably homemade
24 fresh or frozen Chinese-style steamed buns
1 head bibb lettuce, washed, dried, and torn into medium-sized pieces
1 recipe Quick-Pickled Cucumbers with Rice Vinegar","1.
Preheat a sous-vide style water bath to 170°F (77°C). Combine soy sauce, mirin, sugar, fish sauce, scallions, garlic, and ginger in the bowl of a food processor. Process until vegetables are roughly pureed. Transfer pork belly and marinade to a food-saver style vacuum bag and seal. Alternatively, transfer to a heavy duty gallon-sized freezer bag and seal by slowly submerging into a pot full of water, sealing the top just before it goes underwater to remove all air. Transfer to sous vide cooker and cook until completely tender, about 10 hours. Remove bag from cooker and chill thoroughly. Pork belly can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks after cooking if the bag remains sealed.
2.
When ready to serve, open sous vide bag and remove pork belly. Discard solid chunks of fat. Warm congealed liquids in a small saucepan, then strain through a fine mesh strainer. Return to saucepan and simmer until reduced to 2 tablespoons, making sure that the syrup doesn't reduce too far and burn, about 15 minutes.

Old-Fashioned Jelly Roll Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Whether store-bought or homemade, every jelly or jam has a unique consistency and sweetness level, which can make choosing the right one for a jelly roll something of a trick (see note below). For that reason, we love working with homemade cranberry jam, which is wonderfully thick and tart—perfect for pairing with an our apple-cinnamon whipped cream frosting. The cake itself is easy to customize using flavorful oils in place of melted butter—roasted pistachio oil is our favorite—and it can also be filled or finished with any sort of frosting or buttercream.","Yield:Makes one 16-inch roll cake, serving 12 to 16 depending on how it is cut
Active time: About 30 minutes
Total time:About 2 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.2857142857143","Ingredients
For the Cake:
4 large eggs, straight from the fridge (about 7 ounces; 200g)
7 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 1 cup; 200g)
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 ounces pistachio oil, roasted hazelnut oil, or melted ghee (shy 1/2 cup; 85g) or melted butter (about 6 tablespoons; 85g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 14g)
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal blue label (about 1 cup, spooned; 127g)
For the Filling:
1/2 recipe (about 2 heaping cups; 21 ounces; 595g) Cranberry Jam, brought to room temperature; volume and weight for alternative will vary substantially
For the Frosting (optional):
1/2 recipe Apple Cinnamon Sugar
12 ounces heavy cream (about 1 3/4 cup; 340g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line an aluminum half-sheet pan with parchment along the bottom, and grease with pan spray or oil.
2.
For the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the eggs, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Mix on medium-low speed until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is homogenous, smooth, and runny, but with fine bubbles beginning to form throughout, about 3 minutes.
3.
Increase speed to medium and whip until the mixture is pale yellow, thick enough to fall from the whisk in ribbons, and filled with fine, foamy bubbles, about 5 minutes. Finally, increase speed to high, and continue whipping until the mixture is quite pale, roughly doubled in volume, and thick enough that the whisk leaves a vortex-like pattern in its wake, about 5 minutes. When allowed to run off the whisk and into the bowl, the mixture should be able to briefly mound up on itself before leveling off. Please bear in mind all times are ballpark figures only, and may vary considerably depending on the power and capacity of a given stand mixer, along with factors such as bowl-to-beater clearance (more on that here). In all cases, the visual and textural cues should be the primary guideline to determine readiness.
4.
Once the foamed eggs are fluffy and thick, reduce speed to medium-high and add the vanilla and oil or melted butter all at once in a steady stream. Immediately reduce speed to medium-low, and add the sifted flour all at once. When the flour is nearly incorporated, shut off the mixer and remove the whisk attachment. Grasping the attachment by its top, give the batter a few strokes of the whisk by hand to finish incorporating the flour. Fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then scrape into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Bake until puffed and lightly browned from edge to center, and firm to the touch but still puffy and soft enough to retain a shallow impression when gently poked, about 12 minutes.
5.
Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, cover the half-sheet pan with two large strips of foil, using a kitchen towel or oven mitt to crimp the foil around the edges of the pan. Allow the cake to cool until approximately 70°F (21°C) (if not allowed to cool sufficiently, it may cause the filling to melt; if cooled too much, it may harden in the cold and thus crack when rolled).
6.
Loosen the edges of the cooled cake from the pan with a butter knife, and give the cranberry jam a good stir before spreading it into an even layer over the cake. Please see the note about using other jams or jellies, as the exact amount (in terms of both weight and volume) will differ substantially depending on the consistency and moisture content. Working along the widest end, lift the edge of the cake by the parchment underneath and gently fold it inward until it turns over itself. Continue rolling, using the parchment to lift and maneuver the cake; it will naturally peel away as you go.
7.
After rolling, transfer the cake to a large platter and serve right away, or cover with plastic until needed. If you like, make a simple frosting by whipping the apple-cinnamon sugar, cream, and salt together until thick and stiff enough to spread; this can be refrigerated in an airtight container and used to cover the cake just before serving. Alternatively, the cake can be finished with a dusting of powdered sugar. Unfrosted, the cake will keep for about 24 hours at room temperature; if frosted with whipped cream, it will need to be covered, refrigerated for up to 24 hours, and then set out to room temperature about an hour before serving.

Malted milk powder bumps up the earthiness of pumpkin, and helps with browning, too.","Yield:Makes about fourteen 2-inch wedges
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:3 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.7777777777778","Ingredients
For the Streusel Topping:
1 1/2 ounces old fashioned rolled oats, not quick cooking or instant (about 1/3 cup; 45g)
1/2 ounce all-purpose or whole wheat flour (about 1 shy tablespoon; 14g)
1/2 ounce light brown sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 14g)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 ounce unsalted butter, softened to about 70°F/21°C (2 tablespoons; 30g)
2 ounces white chocolate, such as Green & Blacks (about 1/3 cup; 55g), chopped into 1/4-inch pieces
4 ounces raw pecan pieces (about 2/3 cup; 110g)
For the Pumpkin Skillet Batter:
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
4 ounces white chocolate, such as Green & Blacks (about 2/3 cup finely chopped; 110g)
1 1/2 ounces malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farms, (about 3 tablespoons; 45g)
10 ounces light brown sugar (about 1 1/4 cups, gently packed; 280g)
5 ounces unsalted butter, pliable but cool, about 60°F (about 10 tablespoons; 140g)
1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g)
4 ounces pumpkin or butternut squash puree, canned or homemade (about 1/2 cup; 110g)","1.
For the Streusel Topping: In a medium bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), combine the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and softened butter. Combine by hand (or with a paddle attachment) to smash the butter into the dry ingredients, until everything is coated and clumpy. Add the white chocolate and pecans and continue smashing (or mixing) to form a clumpy mix. Cover and refrigerate until needed, or transfer to a zip-top bag and freeze for up to 3 months.
2.
For the Pumpkin Skillet Batter: In the bowl of a food processor, grind the flour, white chocolate, and malted milk powder to form a fine, dry mix with no visible lumps of white chocolate. Alternatively, grate the white chocolate with a Microplane, then whisk with flour and malted milk powder to combine. Set aside until needed, or transfer to an airtight container and store at cool room temperature until the date stamped on the bag of flour.
3.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the brown sugar, butter, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and vanilla. Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until very soft, pale, and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Along the way, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula as needed.
4.
While mixing on medium speed, add the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, and add the pumpkin purée. Once smooth, add the malted white chocolate-flour all at once, and continue mixing to form a thick batter. Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then fold once or twice to ensure it's well mixed from the bottom up.
5.
Scrape the batter into a lightly greased cast iron skillet (the leftover butter wrappers should do the trick), and spread into an even layer. Scatter the prepared streusel topping over the top in an even layer, and bake until the ""cake"" is puffed, golden brown, and approximately 205°F in the center, about 35 minutes.
6.
Cool to room temperature before serving, as the ""cake"" will seem gooey and wet while warm due to the molten cocoa butter in the white chocolate. When cool, cut into wedges with a sharp knife, and serve alongside a strong cup of coffee or tea for brunch or dessert. Individually wrapped in plastic, the portions will keep at room temperature for several days.

Rack of lamb isn't cheap, so it's understandable that cooking it can be even more nerve-wracking than cooking a pricey steak. What's more, lamb tends to be leaner and smaller than a steak, which means that it's even more susceptible to accidental overcooking. All of this makes it an ideal candidate for cooking sous vide, which makes overcooking nearly impossible and perfectly edge-to-edge medium-rare results the norm.","Yield:Serves 3 to 4
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.2","Ingredients
2 (8-bone) racks of lamb, about 2 pounds (900g) total
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Aromatics, such as fresh thyme or rosemary sprigs, sliced shallots, and sliced garlic (optional)
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil
2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter","1.
Preheat a sous vide cooker to desired final temperature according to chart above. Season lamb generously with salt and pepper. Place racks in two individual sous vide bags, along with herbs, garlic, and shallots (if using), and distribute evenly. Seal bags using a vacuum sealer, or seal plastic zipper-lock bags using the water displacement method. Place bags in preheated water bath for desired time according to chart above.
2.
Remove lamb from bags and carefully pat dry with paper towels.
3.
Turn on your vents and open your windows. Add vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil to a heavy cast iron or stainless steel skillet set over the hottest burner you have. Preheat skillet until it starts to smoke. Gently place lamb, meaty side down, in skillet, using your fingers or a set of tongs. (Work in batches if pan is not large enough to accommodate both racks.) Add 1 tablespoon butter per rack, along with fresh aromatics. Sear first side, moving rack around pan and basting it with hot melted butter and herbs, until well browned, 30 to 45 seconds. Flip and brown second side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet to rest, then repeat with second rack if necessary, using fresh butter and aromatics.
4.
Lamb can be immediately carved and served as directed in step 5. Alternatively, allow it to rest for up to 10 minutes while you set the table. To re-crisp, reheat pan drippings until smoking-hot, then pour them over resting lamb racks just before carving and serving.
5.
Transfer cooked lamb to a cutting board. Carve it by holding rack upright (the bones make a good handle) and slicing down after every two rib bones with a sharp knife. You'll have to work your knife around a little bit to find the joint between the vertebrae as you reach the bottom. (Don't force your knife through a bone, or you may chip or dull it.) Serve immediately.

There's no doubt that Beef Wellington is delicious. How can it not be? The exterior is a light, crisp, buttery crust, glazed a deep, shiny golden brown, twinkling with crystals of sea salt. You slice through it to reveal layers of the finest ingredients in the Western world: slivers of prosciutto, a duxelles of wild mushrooms bound with cream, and finally foie gras, all encasing a core of medium-rare, buttery-soft beef tenderloin.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 1 1/2 hours
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 4.4545454545455","Ingredients
1 center-cut beef tenderloin, timmed of silverskin and fat, about 2 pounds (see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon vegetable or canola oil, divided
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 tablespoon dijon, spicy brown, or hot English mustard
1 pound mushrooms (button, cremini, shiitake, portabello, or a mix) cleaned, trimmed, and roughly chopped
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 medium shallots, finely sliced (about 1/2 cup)
2 teaspoons finely minced fresh thyme leaves
1/2 cup cognac or other brandy or barrel-aged spirit such as bourbon
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons soy sauce
4 ounces fresh foie gras (about two 1/2-inch slabs, see note)
1 sheet fillo dough
1/4 pound prosciutto, sliced paper thin
Flour for dusting
14 ounces frozen or homemade puff pastry, thawed (see note)
1 egg, beaten
Coarse sea salt, such as Maldon or fleur de sel
1 bunch finely minced chives","1.
Using butcher's twine, tie tenderloin at 1-inch intervals. Trim ends of twine. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
2.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add tenderloin and cook without moving until well-browned on first side, about 2 minutes. Rotate tenderloin and continue cooking until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a large plate.
3.
Combine horseradish, mustard, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. When tenderloin is cool enough to handle, cut off and discard twine, then rub on all surfaces with horseradish/mustard mixture. Place in refrigerator, uncovered.
4.
Place half the mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor and pules until very finely chopped, scraping down sides and redistributing mushrooms with spatula as necessary, about 10 short pulses. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining mushrooms.
5.
Heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have exuded all their liquid and start to sizzle, about 8 minutes. Continue cooking until mushrooms begin to brown and leave browned bits stuck to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes longer. Add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 2 minutes.
6.
Add brandy. Scrape bottom of skillet with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to release browned bits. Continue to cook until brandy is nearly dry, about 4 minutes. Add heavy cream and soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring frequently until mixture is thick and collects in one large mass when you shake the skillet. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and place in the refrigerator.
7.
Season foie gras liberally with salt and pepper. Heat remaining half teaspoon oil in a a small cast iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Add foie gras and cook without moving until well browned on first side, about 30 seconds. Carefully flip with a small offset spatula and brown second side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer foie gras to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour rendered fat into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and return to refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to split each piece of cooked foie gras in half horizontally. Transfer to a plate and place in refrigerator. Allow all ingredients to chill for at least 30 minutes.
8.
Lay a double layer of plastic wrap about 2 feet long and 1 food wide on your cutting board. Lay fillo dough on top of plastic wrap. Shingle prosciutto on top of fillo to create a thin, even, overlapping layer, leaving a 2-inch border along the bottom and top of the fillo dough. Spread mushroom mixture evenly over ham layer.
9.
Place tenderloin along the very bottom edge of the ham/mushroom layer. Spread sliced foie gras evenly over top of tenderloin (see note). Carefully roll tenderloin in mushroom, hamd, and filo, using the plastic wrap to help tighten it as you roll. Once beef is completely rolled up, re-wrap with more plastic wrap, twisting the ends to make sure roll is very tight. Return to refrigerator.
10.
Dust board or countertop lightly with flour. Spread puff pastry on board and, using a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle at least 4-inches wider than the beef roll on its shorter side.
11.
Unwrap beef roll and place along very bottom edge of puff pastry with the foie gras side facing up. Brush 6 inches of puff pastry just above beef roll with beaten egg. Carefully roll the beef in the puff pastry until it is completely wrapped. You should end up with the foie gras-side facing up again, with the puff pastry seam meeting on the bottom. Trim pastry with a sharp knife.
12.
Fold sides of puff pastry protruding from either end of the beef roll towards the center, then fold the top flaps down. Trimm off the bottom flaps carefully.
13.
Roll entire beef roll over so that the bottom is facing up, the fold up the end flaps to seal completely. Roll beef back right-side up. Transfer to a plate and chill for at least 30 minutes.
14.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Transfer Wellington to a foil-lined baking sheet and brush all over with beaten egg. Use a sharp paring knife to score a decorative pattern in the pastry. Sprinkle liberally with coarse sea salt. Bake until pastry is golden brown and center of roast registers 110°F (43°C)for rare or 120°F (49°C) for medium-rare on an instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest for ten minutes.
15.
Use a thin metal spatula to loosen Wellington from foil, then carefully transfer to a carving board. Slice off the ends with a sharp knife. Carve Wellington, sprinkle cut surfaces with chives and more coarse salt, and serve.

Hummingbird Skillet Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Hummingbird cake is a classic Southern dessert. It has a similar look and feel to carrot cake, down to the light and tangy cream cheese frosting, but pineapple and banana take the place of the carrots, for a tropical twist. It's almost always served as a stately layer cake, but a cast iron skillet dresses it down into a more casual affair, one that's easy to transport and perfect for potlucks and picnics alike.","Yield:Makes one 10-inch cake, or 12 two-inch wedges
Active time: About 45 minutes
Total time:About 3 hours

Getting Ready:
4 ounces pecan pieces (about 3/4 cup; 113g)
1 small pineapple
1 small banana
For the Cake:
6 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 170g)
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
2 large eggs (about 3 1/2 ounces; 100g), straight from the fridge
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
6 ounces unsalted butter, melted (about 3/4 cup; 170g)
5 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (shy 1 1/4 cups, spooned; 155g)
To Finish:
2 cups cream cheese frosting, Cream Cheese Buttercream, or another topping of your choice
Toasted pecans, to taste","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Toast pecans on a half-sheet pan until golden brown, about 10 minutes, then let cool completely. (The pecans may be toasted in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for several weeks.) Meanwhile, peel, trim, and core the pineapple and measure 5 ounces (about 2/3 cup; 140g) fruit into the jar of a blender, or a tall, narrow jar if using an immersion blender. If you like, reserve the pineapple scraps to make fresh pineapple syrup. Peel banana and measure out 3 ounces fruit (about 1/3 cup; 85g) to add along with the pineapple. Blend until smooth. Use purée immediately or refrigerate up to 3 days and bring to about 70°F (21°C) before use.
2.
For the Cake: Combine sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, nutmeg, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and whip until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add melted butter in a steady stream, then reduce speed to low and add flour. Once smooth, add fruit purée and mix only until well combined. Fold in toasted pecans with a flexible spatula, scraping the bowl along the bottom and sides to ensure batter is well mixed throughout.
3.
Bake until the cake is well risen and golden brown, about 45 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center will have a few crumbs still attached when removed, and your fingertip will leave a slight indentation in the puffy crust. Transfer to a heat-safe surface or a wire rack and cool until no trace of warmth remains, at least 90 minutes. (The time will vary depending on the cast iron's gauge and the type of cooling surface.)
4.
To Finish: Top the cake with about 2 cups of your favorite cream cheese frosting or buttercream, along with a scattering of toasted pecans. Enjoy immediately or leave at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 24 hours at cool room temperature. After cutting, wrap leftover slices individually and store at cool room temperature up to 2 days more.

Classic Rich and Silky Potato Gratin (Scalloped Potatoes) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
After rounds and rounds of testing, we've finally landed on the perfect classic potato gratin (also known as scalloped potatoes or au gratin potatoes), one that's creamy, silky, and loaded with flavor. To make it, thinly sliced russet potatoes are layered with earthy Gruyère and nutty-sweet Parmesan before being slowly baked in a bubbling bath of milk and cream. Going low-and-slow in the oven gently reduces the milk and cream, which breaks and coagulates into creamy curds within the layers of potato. A final blast under the broiler browns the top and yields a crispy golden crust.","Yield:Serves 6 as a side
Active time: 30 minutes

In a small saucepan, combine cream, milk, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, thyme, peppercorns, and salt. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 1 hour.
2.
Return milk mixture to boil, then strain into a large heatproof bowl, pressing gently on the solids.
3.
Using a mandoline, slice the potatoes crosswise 1/8 inch thick, directly into the hot milk mixture. Stir the potatoes to fully coat.
4.
Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). In a small bowl, combine the Gruyère and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
5.
Grease a 2-quart baking dish with the butter. Lay the sliced potatoes in one even layer, then sprinkle with the cheese mixture. Repeat layering potatoes and cheese until all the potatoes have been used and half the cheese mixture remains; leave the top layer without cheese. Pour any remaining milk mixture over the layered potatoes.
6.
Bake until the potatoes have become tender and the surface is lightly golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours. Top with reserved cheese mixture, switch the oven to broil, and broil until evenly browned on top. Allow the gratin to rest 30 minutes before serving.

Extra Crispy Duck Fat-Fried Fingerling Potatoes Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
There are three keys to getting extra crunchy fried potatoes: First, you've got to cook them for long enough to allow the gluey starch inside the cells to dissolve and work on the cell walls, gluing them into a thicker, more robust shape. Secondly, you've got to heat their surface in order to dehydrate and crisp them. Finally, you have to maximize the surface area, giving the potatoes more places to crisp up.
With french fries, you do this by parboiling them, then frying them twice. But when I've got a batch of fresh-from-the-dirt new fingerling potatoes in my hands—like I did last night—I prefer to use a different method.
I start by scrubbing the potatoes clean, then placing them in a pot, and covering them with cold, salted water, which I then put on a burner and bring to a boil. By starting the potatoes in cold water, they cook much more evenly, preventing the exterior of the potato from overcooking before the center is finished, as it would be if I started with boiling water. Russian Banana fingerlings like the ones I used here are particularly prone to becoming mushy when overcooked, so I have to keep an eye on them.
After they've cooked through, I allow them to cool just a bit, then split them in half. The exposed surface is slightly sticky and gluey—all the better to crisp up when I fry them—and cooked enough that they get slightly roughened up in the slicing process, increasing the surface area.
Then all that's left is to fry them face down in a little fat until crisp. A bunch of us visited LaBelle Farms on Saturday—a foie gras farm in the Hudson Valley (more on that later)—where I came home with a quart of duck fat. Duck fat and potatoes love each other.
A dish this simple calls for nothing more than a sprinkle of coarse sea salt. (Though some garlicky mayo wouldn't hurt either).
The great thing is that I can boil and slice the potatoes even a day in advance, then all I've got to do is crisp them up right before serving.
Note: If you don't have duck fat, bacon fat, lard, or any other animal fat will work best (more highly saturated fats work better at crisping foods). Otherwise, substitute with peanut or vegetable oil.","Yield:4, as a side
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:20 minutes","Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes, scrubbed clean
Kosher salt
3 tablespoons duck fat (see note)
Coarse sea salt, like Maldon","1.
Cover potatoes with cold water in a saucepan. Add about 2 tablespoons kosher salt to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and allow to cool five minutes.
2.
Split potatoes in half lengthwise. Heat duck fat in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until melted. Turn off heat. Add half of potatoes, cut side down. Return to high heat and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Add remaining potatoes to skillet cut-side down and repeat. Serve immediately, sprinkled with coarse sea salt.

"Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Bacon, Pecans, and Maple-Balsamic Vinaigrette Recipe",,"[Photograph: Jennifer Segal]
These Brussels sprouts are roasted until golden and caramelized, then doused in a maple-balsamic vinaigrette and topped with crisp bacon and toasted pecans. They're so addictive, it's hard not to eat the entire lot standing at the stove before you serve them.","Yield:serves 4 to 6
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1/2 cup pecans
6 slices bacon
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, halved (stems and ragged outer leaves removed)
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon maple syrup","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil.
2.
Place pecans on prepared baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on them, as they can burn fast. Transfer nuts to cutting board and chop coarsely. Set aside.
3.
Increase oven temperature to 400°F. Lay the bacon strips out flat on the same foil-lined baking sheet, leaving space in between so they don't overlap. Roast for until bacon is crisp, 12 to 20 minutes, rotating half way (cooking time will depend on thickness of bacon). Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels; pour rendered bacon fat into a small dish and discard aluminum foil. When bacon is cool, finely chop.
4.
Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Line baking sheet with fresh aluminum foil. Toss Brussels sprouts with rendered bacon fat, olive oil, salt, and pepper, directly on baking sheet. Roast, stirring midway through to promote even browning, until Brussels sprouts are tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar and maple syrup and toss to coat evenly. Taste and adjust seasoning then transfer to serving dish. Right before serving, top with chopped pecans and bacon. Serve hot or room temperature.

Vegan Garbanzos con Espinacas y Jengibre (Spanish Chickpea and Spinach Stew With Ginger) Recipe,,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
This chickpea and spinach stew is based off of the garbanzos con espinacas that I used to make with Chef John Critchley over at Toro in Boston. It's about as classic a Spanish bar snack as there ever was and you'll find it all over Spain flavored with everything from smoky chorizo and rich morcilla (blood sausage) to simpler preparations served with nothing but a spritz of bright vinaigre de Jerez.
This vegan version, which ends up somewhere between a soup and a stew, relies on canned chickpeas and their liquid for body, but giving them a bit of a simmer with some aromatics—garlic, onion, bay leaf, and smoked paprika—adds a ton of flavor back to them. The unique part is the bit of ginger added into the pureed tomatoes. It's not enough to make itself obvious, but just enough to add a bit of complex heat to the saucy backbone of the dish.","Yield:serves 2 with leftovers
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 1-inch knob ginger, peeled
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (plus more for serving)
1 medium onion, finely sliced
4 cloves garlic, finely sliced
1 teaspoon sweet or hot smoked paprika
12 ounces fresh spinach, roughly chopped
2 (14-ounce) cans garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons soy sauce
Kosher salt
Sherry vinegar for serving (optional)","1.
Drain tomatoes in a metal strainer set over a medium bowl. Transfer liquid and half of tomatoes to a blender along with ginger. Blend on high speed until completely pureed. Set aside. Roughly chop remaining peeled tomatoes and set aside separately.
2.
Heat olive oil in a large straight-sided skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add onion, garlic, and paprika, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and very slightly browned. Add tomato-ginger puree (it should immediately start simmering) and stir to combine. Add spinach a handful at a time, allowing each handful to wilt before adding the next. Reduce heat to medium and allow spinach mixture to simmer, stirring occasionally, until spinach is completely tender, about 10 minutes.
3.
Add chopped tomatoes, garbanzo beans (with their liquid) bay leaves, and soy sauce, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened into a thick stew, about 30 minutes total.
4.
Season to taste with kosher salt and serve immediately, drizzling with extra virgin olive oil and a a few drops of sherry vinegar.

Roast Turkey in Parts Recipe,,"[Photograph: Liz Clayman]
Cutting a turkey into parts is the easiest way to make sure that both the breast and the leg meat come out cooked evenly and to the correct temperature.","Yield:Serves 8 to 12
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:5 hours, plus overnight rest if dry-brining
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 whole turkey, 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8kg)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped (about 2 cups)
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
2 large ribs celery, roughly chopped (about 1 cup)
2 medium cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
2 bay leaves
12 whole black peppercorns
1 quart (900ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, divided
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil
3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter
3 tablespoons flour
1/4 teaspoon Marmite
1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce","1.
Using a sharp knife, remove legs from turkey and set aside. Using a large cleaver or heavy chef's knife, cut backbone and carcass away from the turkey breast. Separate turkey wings from breast. Chop backbone and carcass into rough pieces with the cleaver. Season liberally with salt and pepper. For best results, transfer turkey parts to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and let rest, uncovered, overnight in refrigerator (see note).
2.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns evenly across a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 cup (240ml) stock into baking sheet; reserve remaining stock. Place a wire rack on top of the baking sheet. (It may rest directly on top of vegetables—this is okay.) Set aside. Place turkey on top of rack on top of vegetables, trying to leave a little space between the turkey pieces.
3.
Roast turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast piece registers 150°F (66°C), 2 to 3 hours total. Remove breast and set aside. Continue roasting legs until an instant-read thermometer registers 170°F (77°C) when inserted into leg, about 30 minutes longer. (Depending on the pieces' arrangement, the legs might finish at the same time as the breasts.) The turkey pieces will not be browned. Set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Strain vegetables from tray. Reserve liquid and discard vegetables.
4.
While Turkey Is Roasting, Make the Gravy: Roughly chop carcass and neck into 1-inch chunks. Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Add turkey carcass and cook, stirring frequently, until well browned on all surfaces, about 10 minutes. Add remaining stock. Add water until turkey pieces are barely covered. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and allow to simmer while turkey roasts.
5.
While turkey is resting, pour stock through the same strainer and add to reserved stock from strained vegetables. Discard solids. If desired, cut giblets into 1/4-inch pieces. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Add giblets and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour is light blond in color. Slowly whisk in reserved stock, Marmite, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until desired consistency is reached, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6.
30 Minutes Before Serving Turkey: Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Place turkey in oven and cook until crisp and browned, turning breast once during cooking. Serve immediately with gravy.

Easy One-Bowl Oatmeal Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
My oatmeal cookies are thick and chewy, thanks to a resting period that lets the oats soak up moisture from the dough.

If you think snickerdoodles are simply cinnamon sugar cookies, think again. Properly made, they have crispier edges and chewier middles, with a rich and tender crumb beneath their shimmery crusts. Once upon a time, those qualities came from cutting butter with hydrogenated shortening, but virgin coconut oil does a better job. Its subtle aroma heightens both the cinnamon and the vanilla, while helping the snickerdoodles stay rich, moist, and chewy.","Yield:about 2 dozen 3 1/2-inch cookies

4 ounces unsalted butter (1 stick; 114g), firm but pliable, about 60°F (16°C)
3 ounces virgin coconut oil (heaping 1/3 cup; 85g)
10 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1 1/2 cups; 298g)
1 1/4 teaspoon (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight)
1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g)
10 1/2 ounces low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 1/3 cups, spooned; 295g)
For the Cinnamon Sugar:
2 ounces sugar (1/4 cup; 57g)
2 3/4 teaspoons (5g) ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons (1.25g) freshly grated cinnamon","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C). Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed to combine, then increase to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 5 minutes, although the exact timing will vary. Halfway through, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and then resume mixing on medium speed. Add the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough.
2.
Using a cookie scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68°F (20°C) before baking.
3.
For the Cinnamon Sugar: Mix sugar with ground and grated cinnamon in a small bowl, adding more spice if you prefer. (It should taste very intense to offset the mild dough.) Roll each portion of dough into a smooth and sticky ball, then tumble in cinnamon sugar until fully coated.
4.
Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan, leaving 2 1/2 inches between balls, then flatten into 2-inch disks about 1/2 inch thick. Generously cover with the remaining cinnamon sugar, creating a thick layer that will crack and crinkle in the oven.
5.
Bake until the snickerdoodles begin to spread, about 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350°F (175°C). Continue baking until firm around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 6 minutes longer. Cool directly on half sheet pan until the crumb is set, about 8 minutes. Enjoy warm, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature.

New England Clam Chowder Recipe,,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
The flavor of a clam chowder should be delicate and mild, the sweetness of the pork complementing the faint bitterness of the clams, accented by bits of celery and onion that have all but dissolved into the broth, fading completely into the background. A good grind of black pepper and a bay leaf or two are the only other seasonings you need, unless you count the requisite oyster crackers as seasoning. I know some Yankees who do.
Note: For best results, use live clams. If live clams are unavailable, skip steps 2 and 4. In step 6, add 1 pound chopped canned or frozen clams to chowder before heating through to serve.","Yield:serves 4 to 6

2 1/2 pounds live cherrystone or littleneck clams (see note)
1 quart whole milk
1 1/2 pounds russet or yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 bay leaves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup heavy cream
Oyster crackers, for serving","1.
Combine salt pork and 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven. over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and pork has begun to brown and crisp in spots, about 8 minutes. Add butter, onion, and celery. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes longer. Add clam juice or water and stir to combine.
2.
Add clams or quohogs and increase heat to high. Cover and cook, opening lid to stir occasionally, until clams begin to open, about 3 minutes. As clams open, remove them with tongs and transfer to a large bowl, keeping as many juices in the pot as possible and keeping the lid shut as much as possible. After 8 minutes, discard any clams that have not yet begun to open.
3.
Add milk, potatoes, bay leaves, and a pinch of salt and pepper to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and starting to break down, about 15 minutes.
4.
Meanwhile, remove meat from inside the clams and roughly chop it. Discard empty shells. Transfer chopped clams and as much juice as possible to a fine mesh strainer set over a large bowl. Let clams drain, then transfer chopped clams to a separate bowl. Set both bowls aside.
5.
Once potatoes are tender, pour the entire mixture through the fine mesh strainer into the bowl with the clam juice rapping the strainer with the back of a knife or a honing steel to get the liquids to pass through. Transfer strained solids to the bowl with the chopped clams. You should end up with a white, semi-broken broth in the bowl underneath, and the chopped clams, potatoes, salt pork, and aromatics in the separate bowl.

Classic Vanilla Butter Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The success of most any cake depends on the temperature of your ingredients. Too warm and the batter will be thin, which will make a cake that's gummy and dense. Too cold and the batter will be heavy and curdled, giving the cake a coarse and muffin-like crumb. These problems can be avoided altogether simply by paying attention to the temperature of your butter, milk, and eggs. With those details squared away, it's easy to whip up a simple three-egg vanilla cake that's fluffy, tender, and perfectly moist.","Yield:Serves 16
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Cake:
16 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 2 1/4 cups; 455g)
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
8 ounces unsalted butter (16 tablespoons; 225g), soft but cool, about 60°F (16°C)
3 large eggs, brought to about 65°F (18°C)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
16 ounces whole milk (about 2 cups; 455g), brought to about 65°F (18°C)
16 ounces all-purpose flour (about 3 1/2 cups, spooned; 455g)
To Finish:
1 recipe Swiss Buttercream","1.
For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). If you don’t have three pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages, the batter will keep at room temperature until needed.
2.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
3.
With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, then dribble in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.
4.
Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68°F (18 and 20°C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)
5.
Fold batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 20 ounces or 565g if you have a scale). Stagger pans together on the oven rack, and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 32 minutes. If your oven has very uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third when they’re done.
6.
Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right-side-up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare the buttercream.
7.
For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here) and set the scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial here). Refrigerate cake until the buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.
8.
To Finish: Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired. Let the cake sit at room temperature for at least an hour before serving, otherwise it will be too cold inside. Cut with a chef’s knife to serve, and cover the exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.

I have a deep and abiding love for cipollini onions, the little disk-shaped onions that you used to see only in fancy restaurants, but are now available all over the place. They're far sweeter than regular onions, which makes them ideal candidates for caramelization, and the easiest way to accomplish that caramelization is by using the oven. You can use a similar technique to roast pearl onions and shallots, too.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:40 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
4 tablespoons (55g) unsalted butter
2 pounds (900g) cipollini onions, peeled and trimmed
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 325°F. Melt butter in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add onions and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to oven and roast, tossing occasionally, until deeply caramelized and tender, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

The Best Simple Roast Turkey With Gravy Recipe,,"Want crisp, evenly cooked turkey meat? Throw out the roasting pan. [Photographs and video: J. Kenji López-Alt]
We all know by this stage that spatchcocking is the fastest and easiest way to roast turkey. The only downside is that you don't get to deliver that picturesque Norman Rockwell bird to the table. And what if your Auntie Emma insists it's not Thanksgiving unless her turkey comes to the table with its back fully intact? Is there still a method that can get you great results? This recipe uses the power of a baking stone or steel to direct heat exactly where it needs to be, delivering a roast turkey that is crisp-skinned, juicy, and evenly cooked, with no flipping, trussing, or fussing.

1 whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved, about 10 to 12 pounds (4.5 to 5kg) (see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
2 ribs celery, roughly chopped
1 1/2 quarts (about 1.5L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce
3 tablespoons (45g) butter
1/4 cup (1 1/2 ounces) flour","1.
Set oven rack to lowest position and place a baking stone or Baking Steel on it. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Allow to preheat for at least 45 minutes before adding turkey. Meanwhile, rinse turkey and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper. (If turkey has been dry-brined, omit rinsing and salting steps; see note.) Set turkey breast side up in a V-rack over a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.
2.
Transfer rimmed baking sheet with turkey directly to baking stone. Immediately close oven and reduce oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). Roast until turkey is golden brown and deepest part of breast registers 150°F (66°C) on an instant-read thermometer and legs register at least 165°F (74°C), 3 to 4 hours total. (Check on turkey after 2 hours. If skin looks like it is not browning fast enough, turn on convection or increase oven temperature by 50°F/10°C.) Remove from oven and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving.
3.
While turkey is roasting, chop reserved turkey neck into 1-inch chunks with a cleaver. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add turkey neck, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You should have a little over 1 quart of fortified stock; if not, add water or more chicken stock to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.
4.
Finely chop turkey gizzard and liver (if desired). Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped giblets and cook, stirring frequently, until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add fortified broth in a thin, steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5.
Carve turkey and serve with gravy.

Swedish meatballs, stars of 1960s-era cocktail parties and IKEA shopping trips, are, on the surface, pretty simple: a mix of pork and beef that's lightly spiced and served with a rich gravy.

Sweet potato pie is a Southern staple, fragrant with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Most versions pair roasted sweet potatoes with evaporated milk, but my DIY approach simmers them with whole spices in milk and cream. By the time the potatoes are fall-apart tender, the dairy will have fully condensed, enriching the silky custard with notes of toffee and spice. Thanks to my rich, high-moisture crust, you never have to worry about a soggy pie; even under the custard, it will stay flaky and crisp for days.","Yield:Serves 12
Active time: 1 hour (with a prebaked crust)
Total time:2 hours (with a prebaked crust)
Rated: 4.8666666666667","Ingredients
16 ounces peeled, roughly diced sweet potatoes (3 1/3 cups; 455g), from 2 medium sweet potatoes (see note)
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped, seeds reserved for whipped cream topping
2 or 3 cinnamon sticks (about 6 inches total)
1 whole nutmeg (see note)
26 ounces milk (3 1/4 cups; 740g), any percentage will do
6 ounces heavy cream (3/4 cup; 170g)
7 ounces white or lightly toasted sugar (1 cup; 195g)
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (see note)
1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; use half as much if iodized
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 14g)
3 large eggs
Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough, prepared as for a blind-baked pie
Brown Sugar Whipped Cream (optional)","1.
In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine sweet potatoes, empty vanilla pod, cinnamon sticks, whole nutmeg, milk, cream, and sugar. If you have a scale, write down the weight of the saucier and combined ingredients so you can precisely measure the reduction.
2.
Bring to a boil over high heat, then adjust to medium-low and maintain a gentle simmer (higher heat may cause the milk to curdle). Scrape frequently with a flexible spatula to prevent milk solids from building up around the side, and simmer until sweet potatoes are fall-apart tender and dairy has condensed into a thick sauce, about 55 minutes. The saucier should weigh 19 ounces (535g) less than when you started. (Alternatively, total volume, including cooked sweet potato, should be 3 2/3 cups when finished.)
3.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Remove vanilla bean and spices from saucier and purée sweet potato and dairy mixture with an immersion blender until smooth. (If needed, transfer to a smaller container to avoid splashing.) Whisk in ground cinnamon, grated nutmeg, salt, and vanilla, followed by eggs. If you like, strain through a fine-mesh strainer before pouring into prepared pie crust.
4.
Bake pie until gently set in the middle (with an internal temperature of 195°F or 91°C), about 40 minutes. Cool at least 20 minutes before slicing with a chef's knife, pausing to wipe the blade clean as needed. If desired, serve with dollops of Brown Sugar Whipped Cream. Wrapped in plastic, sweet potato pie will keep up to 3 days at cool room temperature.

Perfect Royal Icing Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Team]
Royal icing is uniquely suited to decorating sugar cookies because it dries glossy and firm, protecting your designs from smushing and smudging. It's typically considered little more than edible cement, but that doesn't have to be the case. With a bit of cream for richness, salt for balance, and cream of tartar for acidity, it tastes like more than a simple sugar bomb—especially if you splurge on organic powdered sugar, which has a hint of molasses thanks to the raw cane sugar it contains (more info here).
Just make sure to plan accordingly: Royal icing dries in about four hours and thoroughly sets in six to eight hours.

18 ounces organic powdered sugar (4 1/2 cups; 510g), divided, plus more if needed (see note)
2 1/2 ounces egg whites (1/4 cup; 70g), from 2 large eggs
2 teaspoons (10ml) silver rum or water
1 1/2 teaspoons (7ml) vanilla extract (see note)
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 ounces heavy cream (3 tablespoons; 40g), plus more if needed (optional; for thinning royal icing, if desired)
Gel paste food coloring, optional","1.
To Make the Icing: Measure 16 ounces of powdered sugar (4 cups; 450g) and place in the bowl of a stand mixer, then add egg whites, rum, vanilla, salt, and cream of tartar. Stir with a flexible spatula to form a smooth paste, then set over a gently simmering water bath in a 3-quart saucier and stir until paste is hot to the touch, or about 150°F (66°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add remaining 2 ounces powdered sugar (1/2 cup; 60g), and mix at low speed to combine. Increase speed to medium and beat until thick and frosting-like, about 20 seconds or until the mixing bowl feels cool to the touch. Use immediately as a thick frosting or to make chunky decorations, like the buttons on a gingerbread man or little rosettes on a cake; color, if desired, according to instructions in step 3. For a thinner royal icing, used to make an even glaze for the tops of cookies, or to attempt a more ambitious, elegant design, thin according to instructions in step 2.
2.
To Thin the Icing: Reduce speed to low, add cream, and continue mixing until smooth. Remove bowl from mixer and lift paddle attachment, moving it in a figure 8 pattern as icing streams back into bowl. If the figure 8 disappears in exactly 8 seconds, the icing is ready to use as a cookie glaze. If it melts away faster, thicken by adding a spoonful of powdered sugar. If it takes longer than 8 seconds to disappear, thin by adding a few drops of cream. Repeat this test, making adjustments as you go, until the figure 8 takes exactly 8 seconds to disappear.
3.
To Color the Icing, if Desired: Divide icing among several small bowls, one for each color you'd like to prepare. Cover each with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface. Working with one bowl at a time, stir in a few drops of gel paste. When your desired color has been achieved, immediately transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a #3 pastry tip, or a parchment cone. (For ease of use, I like to stand the bag/cone upright in a small drinking glass.)
4.
To Glaze the Tops of Sugar Cookies: Leaving a 1/8- to 1/4-inch margin (or more, depending on size of cookies), outline baked and fully cooled Rolled Sugar Cookie Cutouts with royal icing, then roughly drizzle the interiors with more icing, using the piping tip to nudge it into an even layer. Work quickly if topping with sprinkles or a secondary icing color, as royal icing will form a crust within 90 seconds. If you'd like to read more on the basics of decorating, check out my Royal Icing Tutorial for lots of photos, videos, and ideas. For cookies to keep around the house, allow royal icing to air-dry until firm, about 4 hours. For cookies to package and ship, allow royal icing to dry until hardened through and through, about 6 to 8 hours more.
5.
Cookies frosted with royal icing can be stored up to 1 week at room temperature; in a pinch, their shelf life can be extended to about 10 days with refrigeration. Unfortunately, cookies with royal icing should not be frozen, as the water in the royal icing will form ice crystals that will melt as liquid water when thawed, creating a blotchy appearance on the surface of the frosting.

A few years ago, when one of my readers asked me to create a gluten-free version of Campbell's green bean casserole, I was excited. Until then, I had never eaten the classic Thanksgiving side. After perfecting the recipe, a funny thing happened: several of my friends revealed themselves to be secret green bean casserole lovers. Now I make this for Thanksgiving every year. Another huge part of the tradition is munching on the freshly fried onion strips.
Canning the Cans Created by Campbell's in 1955, the original recipe uses canned green beans and canned cream of mushroom soup. While de-glutening the recipe, I replaced the canned green beans with frozen because I prefer the texture. (And if fresh green beans had looked good at the market, I would have used those. That said, if you love canned green beans in this dish because that's how you've always made it, use them!)
The canned soup had to go, of course, because it isn't gluten-free. It's replaced with an easy-to-make white sauce and chopped mushrooms. During recipe development I wanted to stay true to the original and not tinker with the flavors too much. Since cream of mushroom soup isn't aggressively mushroom flavored, I used white button mushrooms in the sauce. They do a great job of letting you know they're there but not shouting at your tastebuds. (If you'd like to use a more flavorful mushroom, go for it. This dish welcomes interpretation.)
The last canned good to go was the canned french fried onions. (Which I noticed this year are no longer in a can but rather in a plastic tub.) This is my favorite part of the casserole (anyone else?). I usually double (cough, triple it, cough) because
I
we eat so many before topping the casserole.
To make Thanksgiving prep a little easier, you can make the casserole the night before. (Don't top it with the fried onions the night before or they'll get soggy.) About 30 minutes before you are ready to serve, heat the casserole in the oven and then top with the freshly fried onions.","Yield:6

1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided","1.
For the Onions: In a large zip-close bag, combine cornstarch and white rice flour. Add onions and shake bag to combine. Remove onions from bag; shake off any excess flour.
2.
Fill a large heavy-bottomed skillet (cast iron works best) with 1/2 inch of vegetable oil. Heat oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. (To test your oil, drop one onion slice into it. The onion should sizzle when it hits the oil. If it doesn't, the oil is not hot enough.) Fry a handful of onions, about 4- 5 batches, until golden brown and crispy. (Don't crowd the pan while frying.
3.
Remove onions from oil using a slotted spoon. Place on paper towel-lined plate to drain. If desired, season with salt to taste. Repeat with remaining onions.
4.
For the casserole: Preheat oven to 350ºF. In a medium saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add onion and garlic. Sauté until soft, stirring frequently. Add mushrooms and remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Cook until mushrooms are soft and tender, stirring frequently, about three minutes.
5.
Add 1 3/4 cups of milk and thyme. Bring to a boil. Once the mixture boils, combine remaining 1/4 cup of milk and two tablespoons cornstarch. Stir vigorously with a fork to combine milk and cornstarch. Quickly whisk in cornstarch. Allow to boil for 45 seconds. Remove from heat. Reduce heat to low. Allow to simmer for three minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.

Add green beans, stir to combine. Pour into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Top with half the grated Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes.

Coming up with a vegan holiday roast is a daunting task! It can't just take the place of the turkey or the prime rib nutritionally, it's got to cover all of those mental bases as well. Not only does it have to taste spectacular, but it's got to look stunning at the center of the table, with rich, deep flavors that scream fall and winter. What I ended up with was a vegan roast that is so pretty, so mouth-watering, so packed with flavor and texture that even the hardcore carnivores at the table will want to make room on their plate for a slice, perhaps even instead of that turkey. I call it Vegetables Wellington.
Why this recipe works:
We combine three different mushroom preparations with roasted carrots, dehydrated beans, braised cashews, nuts, and aromatics all wrapped in a phyllo crust for an intense interplay of textures and flavors.
Phyllo pastry brushed with olive oil holds everything together, making for a stunning centerpiece.
Note: This recipe requires you to first make Smoked Mushroom Bacon as well as Hearty Vegetable Stock. Do not be tempted to use store-bought vegetable stock as it is universally poor quality. If you must use store-bought stock I suggest Better than Bouillon Organic Vegetable Base.
Make Ahead: The roasted carrots, duxelles, and bean/cashew mixture can all be made up to three days in advance and stored in sealed zipper-lock bags in the refrigerator.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10

Coarse sea salt
For the Gravy:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons flour
1 quart Hearty Vegetable Stock
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 sprigs thyme
2 bay leaves","1.
For the Carrots: Adjust oven rack center position and preheat oven to 400°F. Place carrots in a large skillet and cover with cold water. Season gently with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender and water has mostly evaporated (if there's still lots of water left after the carrots are fully tender, drain). Season cooked carrots with salt and pepper. Add thyme sprigs to pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss to coat, and transfer to oven. Roast, turning occasionally, until carrots are lightly caramelized and wrinkled in appearance, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, discard thyme, and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
2.
For the Duxelles: Place mushrooms in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add shallots and garlic and cook, tossing and stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and bourbon and cook until almost dry, about 2 minutes. Add bread crumbs and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
3.
In a small bowl, toss bacon mushrooms with maple syrup until thoroughly coated. Roughly chop mixture and add to bowl with duxelles. Add half of parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil and fold mixture together until homogenous. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside.
4.
For the Cashew-Bean Mixture: Place cashews in a medium saucepan and add stock. Season very lightly with salt. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer cashews to the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl.
5.
Spread beans on a foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Transfer to oven and roast, stirring occasionally, until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about 35 minutes. Transfer mixture to the work bowl of a food processor and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425°F.
6.
Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms are beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. Add leeks and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add to food processor work bowl.
7.
Process dried beans and mushroom mixture until roughly chopped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer to bowl with cashews. Transfer sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to work bowl of the food processor and pulse until roughly choped, scraping down sides with a rubber spatula as necessary, 8 to 10 short pulses. Transfer bowl with bean/cashew mixture.
8.
Add remaining parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil to mixture and fold together. Season generously with salt and pepper.
9.
To Assemble: Lay a single sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush with olive oil. (Make sure to keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out). Layer with about 1 1/2 cup bean/cashew mixture, leaving a 2-inch border all around.
10.
Roll the phyllo and stuffing up like a buritto, tucking in the sides about half way through rolling. Set the cigar-shaped roll aside.
11.
Lay a clean sheet of phyllo on your work surface and brush with olive oil. Lay two more sheets on top, brushing each with olive oil as you layer them.
12.
Spread half of mushroom duxelles evenly over bottom two thirds of phyllo sheet, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Lay roasted carrots in even, parallel rows in the mushrooms and cover with remaining mushrooms, pressing down with clean hands to form an even layer. Place the cigar-shaped phyllo roll on top of the carrots and mushrooms.
13.
Roll the phyllo sheet up into a tight cylinder and set aside.
14.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with a large piece of parchment paper and place remaining bean/cashew mixture on top of it in a rough 8-inch by 3-inch row. Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top, followed by a second rimmed baking sheet. Press down firmly all over the baking sheet to spread mixture into a thin, even layer that will roughly fit on a piece of phyllo dough leaving a 2-inch border all around.
15.
Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment paper. Place a single layer of phyllo dough on top.
16.
Brush with olive oil, add another sheet of phyllo, and repeat, adding a total of 5 to 6 layers of phyllo and oil (do not oil final sheet of phyllo) Place a sheet of parchment paper on top of last phyllo sheet, place the second baking sheet on top, and holding both baking sheets together, invert the stack.
17.
Remove the top baking sheet and the top parchment. You should now have 6 layers of phyllo with a thin, even layer of bean/cashew mixture on top.
18.
Place the existing carrot/mushroom roll on top and roll up to secure. Set aside. Lay out a fresh sheet of phyllo and brush with olive oil. Place roll on top and roll up. Repeat, adding more layers of phyllo and olive oil until all of the phyllo is used up. Transfer roll, seam-side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Brush with more olive oil, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and score gently with a sharp paring knife at 1-inch intervals all the way across the top.
19.
Bake until golden brown, crisp, and puffed, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
20.
For the Gravy: While roast is baking, make the gravy. Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk until flour is nutty brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in stock. Add soy sauce, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to 3 cups, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and lots of black pepper.
21.
To Serve: Trim ends off of roast and discard. Carve roast at table, passing gravy alongside.

","Indirect heat and proper coal arrangement is the key perfectly grilled spatchcocked turkey. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
The grill is well-suited to roasted turkey perfection. Situating the darker meat closer to a two-zone indirect fire lets the legs and thighs cook faster than the more delicate breast meat, leaving both sections of the bird to reach their respective ideal temperatures at the same time. Plus there's the bonus of adding wood chunks for lightly smoky, more flavorful meat.
Why this recipe works:
Salting and resting the turkey in the fridge overnight provides extra insurance on moisture retention and flavor
Butterflying the turkey creates a flatter surface that makes for quicker and more even cooking
Placing the legs and thighs closer to the hot coals allow them to cook faster than breast meat
Apple or cherry wood added to the fire gives the meat a delicate smokiness that enhances the flavor of the meat, without overpowering it","Yield:Serves 10 to 12

1 whole natural turkey (12 to 14 pounds total), butterflied according to these instructions, backbone, neck, and giblets reserved for making gravy
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 to 2 small chunks of light smoking wood, such as cherry or apple
1 recipe gravy, for serving
Type of fire: two-zone indirect
Grill heat: medium-high","1.
Pat turkey dry with paper towels and season liberally all over with salt and black pepper. Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.
2.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals in a crescent moon shape on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place wood chunk(s) directly on top of hot coals. Remove rack with turkey from sheet pan and place on grill, with turkey legs and thighs placed closer to the coals. Cover, situating top vent over cool side of grill, and cook until an instant read thermometer registers between 165-170°F in thickest part of the thigh and between 145-150°F in thickest part of the breast, about 90 minutes, replenishing coals after an hour if needed.
3.
Remove rack with turkey from grill and place over a cutting board. Let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes, then remove wire rack and carve turkey. Serve immediately with gravy.

Rich and Creamy Mashed Potatoes Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji López-Alt. Video: Vicky Wasik]
If you like your potatoes rich and creamy instead of fluffy, the key is to allow them to retain some of their starch by cooking them directly in their jackets. Using a ricer, followed by a whip in a stand mixer, guarantees ultra-smooth results. For an even smoother purée, pass the potatoes through a chinois or tamis.

Herb-Rubbed Crisp-Skinned Butterflied Roast Turkey Recipe,,"This herb butter-rubbed variation of our original spatchcock turkey goes from fridge to table in 2 hours. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
So you've seen our spatchcock turkey and you're intrigued by the promise of extra-crisp skin and ultra-moist meat, all in about 90 minutes...but there's just one thing that bugs you: You're the kind of person who likes to put decals on their car or glitter on their greeting cards. In other words, plain old salt and pepper just ain't gonna cut if for ya. Well here's the recipe for you. It's got all of the same crisp skin and juicy meat as the original recipe, but with a flavor-packed herb butter to coat it.
Why this recipe works:
Butterflying the turkey exposes more skin to improve browning and creates more channels for rendering fat. This creates extra crisp skin.
A low profile means the turkey cooks through in under 90 minutes.
The legs lay flatter than the breasts, helping them to reach a higher final temperature without overcooking the breast meat.
Note: For best results, dry-brine your turkey by following the instructions here. If dry-brining, omit any additional salt in herb butter. The neck and backbone of the turkey can be used to fortify stock used to make gravy. Chop them into rough chunks with a cleaver, brown in oil in a medium saucepan along with chopped onions, carrot, celery, and bay leaf, then cover with homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock. Simmer for 1 hour before straining and using to make gravy.

Oh, and it makes bomb French dip sandwiches, too—everybody wins.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:2 hours, plus up to 32 hours resting time (see note)
Rated: 4","Ingredients
1 whole tri-tip roast, about 2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 quart (950ml) beef stock or brown chicken stock (see note)
1 1/4 cups (300ml) red wine, divided
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil
1 pound (450g) shallots, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce","1.
The Day Before Roasting: Using butcher's twine, tie tri-tip at 1-inch intervals using butcher's knots. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least overnight and up to 2 nights.
2.
When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F (105°C). Place baking sheet with rack and tri-tip in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 115°F (46°C) on an instant-read thermometer at the tri-tip's thickest point, about 1 1/2 hours.
3.
Meanwhile, in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine stock and 1 cup (240ml) red wine over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, occasionally scraping down sides of saucier with a rubber spatula, until mixture thickens slightly and is reduced to 2 cups (475ml), 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off heat.
4.
Just before tri-tip comes out of the oven, add oil to a 12-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add tri-tip to skillet and cook, using a small cast iron skillet or weight to press down on tri-tip for even browning. If the beef begins to char or the skillet begins smoking aggressively, reduce heat to medium-high. Cook until tri-tip is evenly browned on all sides and internal temperature registers 130°F (54°C), about 5 minutes.
5.
Transfer tri-tip to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add shallots to now-empty skillet, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are softened and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) red wine to skillet and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
6.
Transfer shallot mixture to saucier with reduced stock and red wine mixture and stir to combine. Bring jus to a simmer over high heat and stir in soy sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
7.
Cut and remove twine from tri-tip, then cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick slices if you are serving the beef as a main course. Slice into thin, 2-inch-wide pieces if you plan to serve the beef in sandwiches. Serve right away, passing shallot jus at the table.

It's the kind of recipe that your guests will demand you make time and time again because they're that damn good. Good thing they're easy as well.
Note: Because of how intensely flavored these garlic knots are, this is one case where store-bought dough (which is often under-seasoned) works just as well as homemade.

Ham is not for everyone, but if you're a ham lover, lucky you, because ham is one meat that's darn difficult to mess up. Want to make it even juicier and more foolproof? Cook the sucker sous vide. Because hams are precooked, it's really just a matter of reheating them. Typically, I'd suggest removing meat from its retail packaging, seasoning it, then resealing it in a sous vide bag before cooking it. But since ham's pre-seasoned, it can be cooked directly in the package it comes in, making the whole process even more appealing.","Yield:Serves 8 to 12
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:3 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 bone-in half ham (7 to 10 pounds; 3.2 to 4.5kg), packing intact (see note)
1 cup (about 225g) brown sugar
1 cup (240ml) balsamic vinegar","1.
Preheat sous vide cooker to 140°F (60°C). Add ham and cook for at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours. Meanwhile, heat brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until melted. Continue to cook until deep brown but not black, and immediately add all of balsamic vinegar, standing back as you add it. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Reduce to a bare simmer and continue to cook until mixture is thick and syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
2.
Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C) 30 minutes before ready to serve ham. Allow oven to preheat for 15 minutes. Remove ham from water bath, remove packaging, and place cut side down on a rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Wipe surface dry with paper towels and brush with glaze.
3.
Place in oven and roast for 5 minutes. Pull out oven rack, apply another coat of glaze, and repeat. Repeat glazing step 2 more times. Remove ham from oven and let rest 5 minutes.
4.
To carve ham, place cut side down on a cutting board and make a single slice right next to the bone, dividing ham in two. Place boneless side with the newly cut side facing down and slice thinly into serving pieces. Repeat with remaining ham, cutting it from the bone one section at a time before slicing it into serving portions.

French 75 Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
According to Ted Haigh (aka Dr. Cocktail), the French 75 is one of two cocktails named after the French 75-mm field gun, which was commonly used in World War I. ""One barman in 1947,"" reports Haigh, ""called it a Tom Collins with champagne instead of club soda. Vive la difference!"" Here's Haigh's version of the recipe, from his wonderful book, Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails.

BraveTart: Homemade Oreo Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
You don't have to hunt down specialty ""black"" cocoa to make authentic Oreos; the only essentials are Dutch cocoa powder and a little baking soda to alkalinize the dough. Together, they make crispy wafers as inky and intense as the original, with a hint of bitterness to balance the sweet vanilla filling. Though it's not a make-or-break ingredient, I've found a little coconut extract gives the cookies an even more authentic flavor—just don't ask me how!

Active time: 1 hour
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 4.8181818181818","Ingredients
For the Chocolate Wafers:
4 ounces unsalted butter (about 8 tablespoons; 115g), creamy and soft, about 68°F (20°C)
3 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1/2 cup; 100g)
2 ounces golden syrup (about 3 tablespoons; 55g), such as Lyle’s
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract (optional)
5 3/4 ounces bleached all-purpose flour (about 1 1/4 cups, spooned; 165g), such as Gold Medal
1 1/4 ounces Dutch-process cocoa powder (about 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 35g), such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute, plus more for dusting
For the Filling:
6 ounces unsalted butter (about 12 tablespoons; 170g)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
8 1/2 ounces powdered sugar (about 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon; 240g)","1.
For the Chocolate Wafer Dough: Combine butter, sugar, golden syrup, baking soda, salt, and coconut extract (if using) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through.
2.
Sift flour and cocoa together. (If using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting.) With mixer running on low speed, sprinkle flour/cocoa mixture into butter mixture. It will seem dry and mealy at first, but continue mixing to form a smooth dough. Knead against sides of bowl to form a smooth ball, then divide in half and flatten into disks. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week; soften cold dough 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare surface until pliable and smooth.
3.
For the Wafers: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). On a cocoa-dusted surface, roll a portion of dough into a 7-inch square. Sprinkle both sides with cocoa and roll until 1/4 inch thick; generously dust with cocoa and continue rolling to 1/8 inch (see note). Alternatively, roll dough to 1/8 inch using an embossed pin. Slide an offset spatula under dough to loosen, brush away excess cocoa, and stamp into 1 1/2–inch rounds.
4.
Arrange on a parchment-lined aluminum baking sheet, leaving 1/4 inch between wafers. Gather scraps, knead, re-roll, and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough as well. Any remaining scraps can be discarded or baked to grind for crumbs. Bake until wafers are firm and dry, about 15 minutes, and cool to room temperature on the baking sheet. Fill immediately or store in an airtight container up to 1 week at room temperature.
5.
For the Filling: Before making the filling, flip half the chocolate wafers upside down so they can be filled immediately after preparing the filling, as it will quickly set.
6.
In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, completely melt butter over medium-low heat. Simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula, while butter hisses and pops; if you notice brown bits forming along the edges, reduce heat to low. Continue cooking and stirring until butter falls silent, then strain into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
7.
Add vanilla and salt, followed by powdered sugar. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a heavy-duty pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip and use immediately; this filling cannot be made in advance.
8.
To Sandwich the Wafers: Pipe a generous dollop of filling in the center of each upturned wafer (just shy of 1 tablespoon, or a little more than 1/4 ounce). Sandwich with remaining halves, transfer to an airtight container, and stand at room temperature until filling has set, about 30 minutes. The cookies will keep for up to 1 week at room temperature, up to a month in the fridge, or 3 months if frozen; serve at room temperature.

1 recipe turkey porchetta, prepared through the end of step 7, skipping wrapping and refrigerating step at end of step 5
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) peanut or canola oil for deep-frying, or 2 tablespoons (30ml) canola oil for pan-frying
Kosher salt","1.
After forming and tying turkey porchetta (as described in step 5 of our turkey porchetta recipe), transfer to a sous vide–style vacuum-sealer bag. Seal tightly and let rest for at least 6 hours and up to 2 days.
2.
Preheat sous vide water bath to 140°F (60°C). Add turkey and cook for 4 to 5 hours. Remove and run under cool running water, or transfer to an ice bath to chill for 5 minutes. Remove from bag and add any congealed juices to gravy. Rinse turkey porchetta thoroughly and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Trim ends for a more cylindrical shape, if desired.
3.
To Finish by Deep-Frying: Heat 1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) peanut oil to 400°F (204°C) in a large wok or Dutch oven. Do not fill cooking vessel more than one-third of the way, in order to allow for bubbling and displacement when you add turkey. Carefully slide turkey into oil using spatulas and tongs (it will not be fully submerged). Immediately cover and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until sputtering dies a bit, about 2 minutes. Adjust flame to maintain a consistent 350°F (177°C) temperature. Using a large metal ladle, continuously spoon hot oil over exposed portions of roast until bottom half is cooked and crisp, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook on second side, basting the whole time. Proceed to step 5.

"Easy Lentil Soup With Lemon Zest, Garlic, and Parsley Recipe",,"The secret to a flavor-packed lentil soup? Gremolata: a mixture of parsley, lemon zest, and garlic. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
An easy lentil soup is packed with flavor thanks to a dual-use mixture of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest that gets added both before and after cooking.
Why this recipe works:

2 stalks celery, finely diced (about 1 cup)
1 pound dried brown or Puy lentils
2 bay leaves
2 quarts homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock or vegetable stock","1.
Combine lemon zest, parsley, garlic, and half of olive oil in a medium bowl and stir with a fork until homogenous. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
2.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add leek, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add half of parsley-lemon mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add lentils and stir until coated in oil. Add bay leaves and stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and cook until lentils are completely tender and falling apart, about 1 hour, adding water as necessary (lentils should be fully covered at all times).
3.
Using a hand blender, blend soup until as smooth as desired. Alternatively, transfer half of soup to a standing blender, blend until smooth, and fold back into remaining soup. Whisk in lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, drizzling extra lemon-parsley mixture on top of each serving. Soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

This recipe is my go-to every year. It's chock-full of pecans, and the light caramel custard filling sets up well, making it easy to slice and serve neatly. I love how the filling and the crispy, all-butter crust melt in the mouth, and the smell of toasted pecans permeate the kitchen. If you like a well-done crust, be sure to blind bake the chilled, shaped pie crust by lining it with parchment or foil, filling it with weights (or dried beans), and baking it until the bottom is blond. Then, fill the pie and bake the rest of the way.","Yield:8
Active time: 1.5 hours
Total time:4 hours

One half recipe Easy Pie Dough
3 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons honey
1 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 tablespoons melted butter, cooled
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups toasted pecans (2 cups roughly chopped and 1 cup left whole)","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 375°F.
Roll pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using a pair of kitchen shears, trim the edges of the pie dough until it overhangs the edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of pie dough down, tucking it under itself, working your way all the way around the pie plate until everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges.
2.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, corn syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, salt, and vanilla. Whisk for approximately 30 seconds, until the mixture is homogenous and slightly frothy.
3.
Line pie crust with chopped pecans, reserving the whole ones. Press down slightly so chopped pecans embed in the dough. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, then gently place the whole pecans in concentric circles on the top, taking care not to press too hard, which will cause the nuts to sink into the filling.
4.
Bake pie for 40 minutes, rotating half way through baking. Continue baking, shielding the exposed nuts with aluminum foil if they threaten to burn. When finished, the filling should by slightly jiggly, but mostly set and puffed slightly, about 1 hour total. Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours and up to overnight before serving.

Preheat the broiler and set oven rack in top position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until most of the fat has rendered but the bacon is still pliable. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel–lined plate to absorb excess grease. Set aside.
3.
Using a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the center of each halved fig. Fill each hollowed fig half with blue cheese.
4.
Wrap a half-strip of bacon around each filled fig half and secure with toothpicks. Place, cut side up, on the prepared baking sheet.

5 ounces bleached cake flour (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 140g) (see note)
15 ounces cold egg whites (2 cups; 425g) from 12 large eggs
15 ounces granulated sugar (2 cups; 425g)
1 tablespoon (15ml) vanilla extract
1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 tablespoons; 25g) from 1 small lemon
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
To Serve:
2 pints assorted fruit, such as blueberries, blackberries, and figs (optional)
1 ounce Fresh Lemon Syrup (2 tablespoons; 25g), optional
6 ounces Lemon Chantilly (1 cup; 170g), optional","1.
Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Sift cake flour and set aside. Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to loosen, about 1 minute, then increase to medium-low (4 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes; the whites will be dense and dark.
2.
With the mixer still running, add lemon juice and salt. Immediately increase to medium (6 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes more; the meringue will be thin but foamy. Increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid) and continue whipping until the meringue is glossy white and thick enough that you can see the pattern left by the wire whisk. This can take between 2 and 4 minutes, depending on the freshness of the whites and the horsepower of your mixer. When meringue is ready, it should be soft enough to run off the wires when the whisk attachment is removed, but thick enough to mound up on itself like soft-serve in the bowl.
3.
Sprinkle cake flour on top and stir with a flexible spatula to roughly combine. Switch to a folding motion, scraping from the bottom up and folding through the center, until no pockets of flour remain. Scrape the batter into a 10-inch aluminum tube pan (do not butter or grease pan); if you notice any small pockets of unincorporated flour, simply pause to mix them in. Bake until the cake is puffed, golden blond, and firm to the touch, about 45 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 206°F.
4.
Invert pan onto its stilts or onto a trio of cans (see note) and cool upside down until absolutely no trace of warmth remains, at least 2 hours. Slide an offset spatula around the sides of cake to loosen, remove the insert, and slide spatula under the bottom as well. Flip onto a serving plate, pulling gently on the sides of the cake to release it from the center tube. To serve, cut with a chef's knife, using a gentle sawing motion and only the slightest downward pressure. If you like, garnish with figs and berries tossed in Fresh Lemon Syrup and finish with Lemon Chantilly. Wrapped tightly in plastic, leftovers will keep up to 1 week at room temperature.

1 tablespoon (5g) ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight

1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 15g)
3 large eggs, brought to about 65°F (about 5 1/4 ounces; 150g), see note
12 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 2/3 cups, spooned; 340g)
14 ounces plain Greek yogurt (about 1 3/4 cup; 395g), any percentage will do, brought to about 65°F (see note)","1.
For the Topping: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, cardamom, and butter. Mix on low speed until sandy and well combined. Scrape onto a large plate or sheet of parchment. Alternatively, the crumb topping can be transferred to an airtight container and refrigerated for up to one week, or frozen for six months. Wipe bowl and paddle with a paper towel and proceed to the next step—no need to wash!
2.
For the Coffee Cake: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, butter, baking powder, salt, and vanilla. Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and cream until soft and light, about 10 minutes. Pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on medium speed. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each to fully incorporate before adding the next.
3.
Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in about 1/3 of flour, then add 1/3 of Greek yogurt. Repeat with remaining flour and yogurt, working in thirds as before. Fold batter once or twice with a flexible spatula, then scrape into a parchment-lined 9- by 13- by 2-inch anodized-aluminum baking pan. Spread in an even layer, then cover with prepared topping, a handful at a time, squeezing each addition in your palm to help form streusel nuggets.
4.
Bake until coffee cake is puffed and firm, about 40 minutes (a toothpick inserted into the center should emerge with a few moist crumbs). Cool cake directly in pan about 30 minutes before serving, as it will be soft and gummy until its crumb has had a chance to set. Cut into squares with a butter knife and lift parchment to help fit an angled spatula under the first slice. To keep coffee cake as fresh as possible, cut only as much as you plan to serve at one time. With plastic wrap or wax paper pressed against cut surface, and top of pan covered with a sheet of aluminum foil, leftovers will keep up to 3 days at room temperature.

Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Shallots With Balsamic Vinegar Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats Video]
The key to roasting Brussels sprouts is to use the full-on, frontal-assault, no-prisoners-taken, blast-the-sh*t-out-of-'em approach, a.k.a. very high heat. This allows the exteriors of the sprouts to caramelize and brown, producing sweet by-products, while at the same time making sure that they don't have enough time to develop the really sulfurous aromas that slower cooking can yield. Here, we drizzle the sprouts with balsamic vinegar after roasting to provide a nice tart glaze.

The bare bones of this creamed spinach recipe are pretty straightforward and classic: The spinach is cooked low and slow to gradually concentrate its juices. Combined with a creamy béchamel sauce, it reduces into a rich, thick coating with a near pudding-like texture. The only minor embellishments are a doubling-up of the alliums (I use shallots and garlic) and a last-minute shot of crème fraîche, which serves a function similar to when it's added to creamy scrambled eggs at the last minute: a final dose of creaminess and fresh flavor.","Yield:Serves 4

3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 medium shallots, finely minced (about 1/2 cup)
2 medium cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane (about 2 teaspoons)
2 pounds curly spinach, trimmed, washed, and drained
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 cup store-bought or homemade crème fraîche
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated (about 1 cup; optional)","1.
Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach in four batches, turning each batch with tongs or a rubber spatula and allowing it to wilt before adding the next.
2.
Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no dry flour remains. Slowly stir in the heavy cream and milk. Bring to a simmer, stirring, then reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is completely softened and the sauce has thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.
3.
Stir in the nutmeg and crème fraîche and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.
4.
If desired, preheat the broiler to high. Transfer the creamed spinach to a 1-quart oval or round casserole dish and top it with the cheese. Broil until the spinach is bubbly and the cheese has formed a well-browned crust, about 2 minutes. Serve.

Classic Pumpkin Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
I always use homemade pumpkin purée for this pie, which enhances the gorgeous, smooth texture and complex, spicy flavor. Best of all, the filling has just a hint of sweetness, all from brown sugar, so you won't get sweet-fatigue.","Yield:Serves 8

Total time:4 hours
Rated: 3.5","Ingredients
One half recipe Easy Pie Dough, shaped and chilled in a pie plate
15 ounces pumpkin puree
11 ounces evaporated milk
125 grams light brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
Pinch of kosher salt
2 eggs, 2 egg yolks","1.
Preheat oven to 425°F with a baking stone(if you have one) placed on the rack positioned on the lowest rung.
2.
Combine all of the filling ingredients in a saucepan, except for the eggs and yolks. Whisk the mixture over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, until the mixture begins to sputter and steam and looks smooth and shiny. Remove from heat, transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Process for one minute, scrape down the sides, and process for another minute. Stop the machine and remove the cover. Allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. Then, return the lid, and run the processor, adding the eggs and yolks one at a time, processing for 5 seconds each time.
3.
Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared, chilled pie crust. Place the pie on the stone on the lowest rung of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F, then rotate the pie and lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 20 additional minutes, watching closely for any signs of puffing. The pie should be removed from the oven when the filling is set and you should not allow it to puff, which causes dry texture and cracking. Allow the pie to cool completely. Either chill to serve or serve at room temperature.

Apple-Brined and Smoked Turkey Recipe,,"[Photograph: Joshua Bousel ]
A 24-hour brine of salt, brown sugar, apple juice, oranges, ginger, cloves, bay leaves and garlic imparts a subtle, yet complex, flavor to this turkey that's hard to put your finger on, but is insanely delicious. And while it comes out just fine-and-dandy in the oven, far, far better is to take the bird to a 350°F smoker and add some applewood. We're talking a masterpiece here. Not only are you rewarded with a picture-perfect mahogany skin, but the wood adds a smoky sweetness that will make you question why anyone would ever have turkey any other way. [This recipe is adapted from The Virtual Weber Bullet.","Active time: 3 hours
Total time:2 to 3 days","Ingredients
2 quarts apple juice
1 pound light brown sugar
1 cup kosher salt
3 quarts cold water
3 oranges, quartered
4 ounces fresh ginger, unpeeled and thinly sliced
15 whole cloves
6 bay leaves
6 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1 natural turkey
2 to 3 small chunks of apple wood","1.
Combine the apple juice, brown sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve. Boil for one minute, remove from heat, let mixture come to room temperature, then refrigerate to 40°F.
2.
In a large non-reactive container, combine the apple juice mixture with the remaining brine ingredients. When adding the oranges, squeeze each piece to release the juice into the container, then drop in the peel. Set the turkey in the brine, breast side down, placing a weight on top to keep the turkey submerged if necessary. Place in the refrigerator and let brine for 24 hours.
3.
Remove the turkey from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Place turkey on a rack over a rimmed baking sheet and allow to air-dry overnight in the refrigerator. (This step is optional, but will result in a crisper skin.)
4.
Remove the turkey from the refrigerator, fold the wings under the body and tie the legs together. Allow the turkey to come to room temperature while you prepare the smoker.
5.
Fire up your smoker to 350°F. Add the chunks of apple wood and when the wood is burning and producing smoke, place the turkey in the smoker. Smoke until an instant-read thermometer reads 150°F in the thickest part of the breast, about 2 to 3 hours.
6.
Remove the turkey from the smoker and allow to rest, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes. Carve and serve.

If buttery, tender, sweet poached flavor is what you're after, there's no better way to cook it than sous vide. It's also a heck of a lot more foolproof than boiling or steaming, and affords the opportunity to infuse that lobster meat with extra flavor. Think: lobster with the butter built right into it. Doesn't that sound swell?

Soft and translucent
130°F (54°C)
Tender and succulent

Close to traditional steamed-lobster texture","Yield:Serves 2
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:40 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes
Rated: 3.8571428571429","Ingredients
2 whole live lobsters, about 1 1/2 pounds each (see note)
2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
2 sprigs fresh tarragon
Lemon wedges, for serving
1/4 cup (60ml) Clarified Butter, for serving","1.
Kill each lobster by plunging a knife directly into its head, splitting its carapace in half. Twist off the tail and claws. Discard carapace or save for stock.
2.
Lay tails flat against a cutting board and insert two stiff wooden or metal skewers along the length of the tails, keeping as close to the shell as possible.
3.
Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of water or a steamer to a rolling boil. Add lobster tails and claws and cook for 1 minute. Remove tails with tongs and transfer to ice bath. Continue cooking claws for 4 minutes longer, then transfer to ice bath.
4.
Shuck lobster tails by first squeezing sides of shell inward until they crack. Pull sides of shell outward. The shell should open up easily. Remove tail meat and set aside.
5.
To remove claw meat, break off the small pincer, being careful to get the meat out of it. Using kitchen shears or the spine of a heavy knife, crack bottom of shell to create an opening large enough to extract the meat. Carefully remove claw meat by shaking shell up and down, or by using the back of a wooden skewer to slide it out.
6.
To remove knuckle meat, snip open shells with kitchen shears and use the back of a wooden skewer to remove meat. If knuckles are especially spiky, use a kitchen towel to help grasp them.
7.
Using a sous vide precision cooker, preheat a water bath to desired temperature according to the chart above.
8.
Place meat in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag or a vacuum bag. Add 2 tablespoons (30g) butter and tarragon sprigs. Remove all air from bag using the water displacement method or a vacuum sealer.
9.
Add bagged meat to water bath and cook for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour.
10.
Remove lobster from bag, discard tarragon, and serve immediately with lemon wedges and hot clarified butter for dipping.

"The Best Dinner Rolls (Fluffy, Crusty, and Chewy) Recipe",,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
These aren't exactly classic French rolls, but I'm positive their crackly crust and fluffy interiors will win you over. The trick is something I pulled straight from the bagel playbook—boiling the dough to create a moist skin that bakes up glossy and crisp. The result is simple hard rolls that are perfect for mopping up gravy, dunking in soup, or sandwiching around thick slices of your favorite cheese. Using a yukone—a precooked starchy paste—gives them more tenderness.","Yield:Makes 12 (2-ounce) rolls
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:Up to 15 hours
Rated: 4.7777777777778","Ingredients
For the Yukone:
6 ounces cold water (3/4 cup; 170g)
2 1/2 ounces bread flour (1/2 cup; 70g)
For the Dough:
13 3/4 ounces bread flour (2 3/4 cups; 380g)
1/2 ounce sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)
2 1/2 teaspoons (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) instant dry yeast, such as SAF; not RapidRise or active dry (more info here)
6 ounces cold water (3/4 cup; 170g)","1.
For the Yukone: In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier or 10-inch skillet, combine water and flour. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture comes together in a thick, mashed potato–like paste, about 2 minutes. Scrape onto a plate, spread into a 1-inch layer, and cool until no warmer than 100°F (38°C), about 20 minutes.
2.
For the Dough: Pulse flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Once combined, add cooled yukone and water. Process until dough is smooth, about 90 seconds. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl (the dough will be slightly warm and incredibly sticky), cover with plastic, and refrigerate until roughly doubled in bulk, between 60 and 90 minutes depending on temperature of yukone.
3.
Turn dough onto a clean, un-floured surface, but do not deflate. Cut into 12 roughly equal portions (2 1/4 ounces or 60g each), cupping each beneath your palm and working in quick circular motions to form a smooth ball. Arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, cover with plastic, and refrigerate overnight until puffy and soft, between 8 and 10 hours.
4.
To Finish: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (204°C). Fill a deep pot with about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet or cutting board with a thick layer of paper towels. Cut parchment between each roll with a pair of scissors. Working with 4 dough pieces at a time, use parchment to lift and drop rolls into boiling water so that they are upside down. Boil exactly 60 seconds, then flip right side up with a slotted spoon (so the bottoms can skin over) and transfer to paper towels. (Along the way, the parchment squares can be gently tugged free or allowed to slip off on their own.) Arrange rolls on a parchment-lined half sheet pan; these can be baked immediately or left at room temperature up to 4 hours. Bake until blistered and golden brown all over, about 35 minutes.
5.
Rolls can be served immediately or held at room temperature for up to 6 hours. Reheat in a hot oven for 5 to 10 minutes before serving if rolls have cooled and you prefer them hot.

"Papri Chaat (Indian Street Snack With Potato, Chickpeas, and Chutneys) Recipe",,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Papri chaat is a traditional street snack found all over India. Papris are crispy chips made from a simple wheat dough. Much like nachos, the papris are topped with assorted accoutrements of complementing and contrasting textures and flavors, and always dusted generously with chaat masala, a fragrant and flavorful spice mixture. Traditionally, you find the papris buried under fluffy boiled potatoes, tender chickpeas, cool yogurt, bright mint chutney, sweet-and-sour tamarind chutney, and crunchy sev (fried chickpea noodles), which are the ingredients featured in this recipe. You can make all the components from scratch as written here, or buy premade papris, sev, and mint and tamarind chutneys online or at an Indian grocery.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6 as a snack
Active time: 2 hours
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Papris:
2 cups (260g) atta flour (Indian wheat flour) or whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) kosher salt
1 teaspoon (5g) nigella seeds
1 tablespoon (12g) vegetable oil
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) oil for frying, such as canola, peanut, or vegetable
For the Mint Chutney:
1 bunch (60g) cilantro
1 bunch (60g) mint
Juice from 1 lime (about 30ml)
1 medium (20g) serrano pepper, sliced
For the Tamarind Chutney:
4 medjool dates (40g), pitted
1/3 cup (85g) tamarind paste (not concentrate)
1/2 teaspoon (2g) ginger powder
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Kashmiri red chili powder (see note)
1/3 cup (100g) palm sugar or light brown sugar
For the Sev:
1 cup (115g) chickpea flour
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Kashmiri red chili powder (see note)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) freshly ground black pepper
To Assemble:
1 cup (about 250g) boiled, peeled, and cubed russet potato
1 can (434g) chickpeas, drained (or equivalent freshly cooked from dried)
Chaat Masala spice mixture, to taste
1 pint (450g) whole-milk yogurt
1 small onion, diced
Kosher salt","1.
For the Papris: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and nigella seeds. Add warm water, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms (it should be the consistency of Play-Doh). Knead in the bowl until mixture comes together into a smooth dough, about 5 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let rest for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
2.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough until it is approximately 2 millimeters thick. (You can use the nigella seeds as your guide: The dough should be just barely thicker than the seeds themselves.) Using a fork, prick all over surface of dough. (Alternatively, if left un-pricked, the papris will puff up when fried, and can then be stuffed for sev puri chaat and panipuri.) Using a 1 1/2–inch round cookie cutter, cut rounds from dough and set aside on a floured surface. Any scraps can be gathered and re-rolled until you have no more dough left.
3.
In a large pot, wok, or Dutch oven, heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Working in batches of 6 to 8 pieces, fry papris, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain onto a paper towel–lined sheet tray and season with salt while still warm. Reserve frying oil for sev (below), if making from scratch. The papris will stay crisp in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
4.
For the Mint Chutney: Prepare an ice bath. In a pot of salted boiling water, blanch cilantro and mint until they turn bright green, about 20 seconds. Shock herbs in ice bath to stop the cooking, then drain well. Squeeze out any excess liquid from herbs.
5.
Remove and discard the thick mint stems, then roughly chop herbs and remaining tender stems. In a blender, purée blanched herbs with lime juice, serrano pepper, and just enough cold water to bring the mixture together, taking care not to over-blend and heat up the chutney, which can lead to discoloration. Season with salt to taste. The chutney will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
6.
For the Tamarind Chutney: In a small saucepan, combine dates, tamarind paste, ginger powder, chili powder, and sugar and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes to soften the tamarind paste and dates. Using a blender, purée until smooth, then pass through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any fibrous bits. The chutney will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
7.
For the Sev: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together chickpea flour, chili powder, black pepper, and enough water (1/3 cup to 1/2 cup) to form a mixture with the thickness of pancake batter. Add batter to a piping bag fitted with a number 2 plain round tip, or use a zipper-lock bag with one corner snipped off to create a small opening.
8.
Using the same frying oil as for the papris, heat oil to 375°F (190°C). Pipe squiggles of batter into oil, like a funnel cake, and fry until bubbling ceases. Using a spider or strainer, lift fried sev and transfer to a paper towel–lined sheet tray to drain. Repeat with remaining sev batter. The sev will stay crisp in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
9.
To Assemble: On a large serving plate, spread papris in a single even layer.
10.
In a small bowl, toss potatoes and chickpeas with chaat masala to taste. Spread potatoes and chickpeas all over papris.
11.
In a small bowl, combine yogurt with chaat masala to taste and spoon over potatoes, chickpeas, and papris.
12.
Top with diced onion, mint and tamarind chutneys, and sev. Sprinkle more chaat masala on top and serve right away, preferably with sweet, milky black tea.

Roasted Carrots With Harissa and Crème Fraîche Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji López-Alt. Video: Serious Eats Video]
Carrots have a natural affinity for spices, or, at least, in my home they do. Before they go into the oven, I like to toss them with olive oil mixed with some variety of spice blend, whether it's a chili powder (Japanese shichimi togarashi is great), a curry blend, or, in the case of the recipe here, harissa with a touch of cumin and black pepper. Afterward, I'll toss them with an herb that meshes appropriately—cilantro goes well with harissa, as does a little pool of crème fraîche to keep things cool.

Spanakopita (Greek Savory Greens Pie) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Spanakopita is a traditional Greek savory pie wrapped in flaky layers of crisp phyllo and filled with spinach and salty feta. For a twist on the classic, this version uses an assortment of greens and tender herbs in addition to spinach.
Feel free to mix and match whatever quick-cooking greens you have on hand—we recommend a combination of spinach, watercress, Swiss chard, and arugula, but as long as you avoid hearty greens, like kale and collards, any mix can work in this pie. If you prefer to keep things traditional, this recipe works with all fresh spinach as well.","Yield:Make one (9-inch) pie

1 large egg
1/2 pound (226g) Greek feta, crumbled
6 sheets phyllo dough, thawed","1.
Getting Started: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush a 9-inch glass pie plate (either deep-dish or standard size will work with this recipe) generously with olive oil and set on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet.
2.
For the Filling: In a large bowl, combine chopped greens, chopped herbs, 1/4 cup olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Massage together to gently wilt the greens, then set aside.
3.
In a small sauté pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, scallions, and garlic and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the hot mixture to the greens and combine to further wilt the vegetables. Add the trahanas (or your substitute of choice) and egg and thoroughly combine. Once everything is well mixed, fold in the crumbled feta.
4.
To Assemble the Pie: Unroll thawed phyllo and keep it covered with a moist kitchen towel while working. Working with 1 sheet at a time, lay phyllo so that it is centered in the pie pan with the excess draping over the rim and brush generously with about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Repeat with 3 more sheets of phyllo, each sheet placed perpendicular to the previous one, brushing with olive oil before adding the next.
5.
Add greens mixture to phyllo-lined pie. Fold excess phyllo over greens and drape remaining 2 sheets of phyllo over the top. Drizzle with more olive oil. Slice into portions using a serrated knife. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool at least 15 minutes before serving.

This tart combines two bistro classics—French onion soup and tarte Tatin—into a rich, savory appetizer that's perfect for a cold-weather dinner party or holiday meal. While the tart is at its best when made with Stella's old-fashioned flaky pie dough, it works just fine with store-bought puffy pastry as well, for those who don't feel like making dough from scratch.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10 as an appetizer
Active time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough or 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
3 medium yellow onions (about 1 1/2 pounds; 680g) (see note)
4 tablespoons (2 ounces; 56g) unsalted butter, softened, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon (15ml) dry sherry (such as Amontillado)
3/4 cup (180ml) homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought, low-sodium chicken stock
1/4 teaspoon Asian fish sauce (optional)
1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon (2g) chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon (15g) sugar
2 ounces (56g) Gruyère cheese, grated
2 tablespoons (30ml) Dijon mustard (optional)
Freshly sliced chives, for garnish","1.
If using pie dough: Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 10-inch round. Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Cut three 2-inch slits in center of dough, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24. (If refrigerating overnight, cover dough with plastic.)
If using puff pastry: Roll puff pastry out so that you are able to cut a 10-inch round (you can use an inverted 10-inch skillet as a guide for cutting the round). Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Poke the pastry all over with a fork, and refrigerate until ready to use.
2.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 400°F (204°C). Using a sharp knife, trim stem end of onions and halve onions from root end to stem end; peel and discard skin. For two of the onions, trim away the scraggly end of the root, while keeping the light-colored part intact, then cut each half into 4 wedges through the root end to keep wedges intact (giving you 16 wedges total). Set wedges aside. Thinly slice remaining onion.
3.
In a 3-quart saucier or small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add sliced onion, season lightly with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently and adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water at a time when onions begin to stick and threaten to scorch, until onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, about 15 minutes.
4.
Add sherry, and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom and sides of the saucier. Add stock, bring to a simmer, and cook at a steady simmer until onions are jammy, and liquid has thickened and reduced to just coat the onions, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in fish sauce (if using), vinegar, and thyme. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.
5.
Meanwhile, smear butter over bottom of 10-inch oven-safe skillet, sprinkle sugar in even layer over butter, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange onion wedges in a tight circular pattern around edge of skillet, with root ends pointed inward toward center of skillet, making sure wedges are in even contact with skillet. Tuck remaining onion wedges into center of skillet.
6.
Place skillet over high heat, and cook, without stirring, until onions have softened slightly and butter-sugar mixture has turned a dark amber color, 8 to 10 minutes. (Rotate skillet over burner as necessary to encourage even browning.) Reduce heat to medium, spoon caramelized onions into empty spaces between the onion wedges, and continue to cook for 1 minute longer. Turn off heat, and sprinkle Gruyère evenly over onions. Spread mustard evenly over prepared dough or pastry (if using), and carefully place round over onions (mustard-side down), making sure it is centered and not touching the sides of the skillet. Bake until crust is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer skillet to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let cool for 5 minutes.
7.
Place a large plate over the skillet, carefully invert tart onto plate, then slide tart onto wire rack. Rearrange any onions pieces that may have shifted during unmolding, and let tart cool for 30 minutes. Cut into wedges, sprinkle with chives, and serve.

After breaking down and dry-aging ducks on your own, make the work worth it with this show-stopping roast duck breast. A hot-and-fast approach quickly browns the skin and renders fat. The ducks are pulled from the oven before they reach their target internal temperature so as not to risk overcooking, and carryover cooking takes care of bringing the breasts to a juicy, rosy medium.
Sliced and served with a rich red wine duck jus, this roast duck is the Big Duck Project mic drop.","Yield:Serves 4
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:40 minutes
Rated: 4.3333333333333","Ingredients
2 dry-aged duck crowns (see note)
Kosher salt
For Serving:
Coarse sea salt
Red wine duck jus (optional)","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Using a sharp knife, remove wishbone from each duck crown, then pluck any remaining feathers from the breast area. If ducks haven't been brushed with shio koji, season them all over with kosher salt (there is no need to salt them if they have been treated with shio koji). Transfer, breast-side-up, to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.
2.
Roast ducks, rotating baking sheet after 8 minutes, until internal temperature registers between 120°F (49°C) and 125°F (52°C) on an instant-read thermometer at the thickest part of the breast, about 16 minutes.
3.
Transfer baking sheet to kitchen counter, and let duck crowns rest until internal temperature registers between 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare and 135°F (57°C) for medium on an instant-read thermometer at the thickest part of the breast, about 15 minutes. If duck does not reach target internal temperature, return to oven to finish cooking, taking care not to overcook it.

Once rested, transfer duck crowns to cutting board, carve breasts, then slice into pieces; reserve carcasses for duck stock. Serve right away, passing coarse sea salt and duck jus (if using) at the table.

Chocolate-Covered Digestive Biscuits (McVities) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Like graham crackers, digestive biscuits get their distinctive flavor and tenderness from a portion of whole wheat flour worked into the dough. Their crunchy texture and grainy flavor are perfectly offset by a thick layer of dark or milk chocolate, either of which will be easier to temper if you choose a brand with a high percentage of cocoa butter.","Yield:Makes 16 (2 3/4–inch) cookies
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 1/2 hours","Ingredients
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)
2 ounces whole wheat flour (about 1/3 cup; 55g), plus more for dusting
2 1/4 ounces sugar (about 1/3 cup; 60g)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or use the same weight
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (about 8 tablespoons; 113g), cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2 ounces cultured lowfat buttermilk (about 1/4 cup; 55g)
9 ounces roughly chopped dark or milk chocolate (about 1 1/2 cups; 285g) (see note)","1.
Make the Dough: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cubed butter in the bowl of a food processor. Process until butter virtually disappears into a fine, floury meal. Add buttermilk and pulse to form a damp and crumbly dough. Turn onto an unfloured surface and knead into a ball.
2.
Roll and Bake the Biscuits: On a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4–inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.
3.
Bake until firm to the touch and light brown all over, about 18 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.
4.
Temper the Chocolate: Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described here.
5.
Coat the Biscuits: Working with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions here.) Serve biscuits immediately, preferably with hot tea, and transfer to an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.

Double-Chocolate Cream Pie Recipe,,"[Video and Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The best desserts are a study in contrast. This recipe delivers at every turn, with a crisp, flaky crust encasing a rich and creamy dark-chocolate custard, topped off with a light and fluffy vanilla meringue. Since there are a lot of moving parts to coordinate, I like to break the process into more manageable chunks by making the crust a day in advance, but it can certainly be tackled all in one go if you've got a nice stretch of time to spare.

1/4 ounces vanilla extract (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
9 1/2 ounces sugar (1 1/3 cups; 270g)

5 ounces egg yolk (shy 1/2 cup; 140g), from about 8 large eggs
24 ounces milk (3 cups; 680g), any percentage will do
For the Topping:
Swiss Meringue","1.
For the Filling: Place chopped chocolate in a medium bowl, add vanilla, and suspend a large, single-mesh sieve over the top. Whisk sugar, salt, espresso powder, cocoa powder, and cornstarch together in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier. Add egg yolks and roughly 1/2 cup of the milk and whisk until smooth before adding the rest of the milk. Cook over medium-low, stirring gently with a whisk until hot to the touch; about 6 minutes.
2.
Increase heat to medium and continue whisking gently until thick and bubbly, about 5 minutes (if it's not bubbling by then, feel free to crank up the heat). When you see that first bubble, set a timer and continue whisking exactly 90 seconds. Immediately pour into the sieve, pressing with a flexible spatula until custard passes through. Fold until chocolate has melted into the custard, and cover with a heavy towel.
3.
For the Topping: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375°F. Prepare Swiss Meringue as directed. Pour custard into the prepared crust, and dollop meringue over top. Gently spread it edge to edge with the back of a fork, using the tines to sculpt it into a pretty design. Place on a wire rack set inside a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet and bake until well browned, about 15 minutes (this set-up minimizes heat transfer to the custard).
4.
To Serve: Cool 1 hour at room temperature, then cover loosely in plastic and refrigerate to an internal temperature of 60°F, about 3 1/2 hours. Cut with a wet chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean with cold water between each slice. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers can be refrigerated up to a week.

This cheesy and addictive South American bread goes by many names, but whether you call it pão de queijo, cuñapes, or pan de bono, it's always equally delicious. This version is made with Brazilian fermented tapioca starch for extra tang and an authentic flavor. A combination of chopped cheddar and Grana Padano cheeses add both a stretchy texture and salty bite.

160 grams (2/3 cup) whole milk, cold or scalded
30 grams (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs
100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) sharp Cheddar cheese, chopped
160 grams (5.7 ounces) Grana Padano cheese, chopped","1.
In a large mixing bowl, combine tapioca starch, salt, baking powder, milk, butter, and eggs (for an evenly textured bread use scalded milk; for pops of crusty cheese use cold milk—the choice is yours). Using your hands, knead dough until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes.
2.
Add chopped cheddar and Grana Padano to the dough. Knead gently to evenly distribute the cheeses while allowing some larger chunks of cheese to remain, about 2 minutes.
3.
Cover the tapioca dough with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the dough's surface. Refrigerate overnight to allow the starch to fully hydrate.
4.
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and adjust oven rack to the center position. Remove the tapioca dough from the refrigerator and roll into 2-inch balls using the palms of you hands. Make an indentation in the bottom of each roll using the back of a wooden spoon or your thumb.

Brown Butter Shortbread Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Classic vanilla shortbread get an upgrade with brown butter, toasted sugar, and malted milk powder, ingredients that layer in all kinds of warm and nutty flavors. The result is a deceptively simple cookie that's rich and buttery, with hints of caramel and butterscotch. Thanks to their low moisture content, these sandy shortbread cookies will keep for weeks in an airtight container, so load up the cookie jar now!","Yield:Makes about twenty-four 1 1/2–inch cookies
Active time: About 45 minutes
Total time:About 6 hours
Rated: 4.7142857142857","Ingredients
5 ounces refined white sugar (shy 3/4 cup; 140g)
5 ounces unsalted butter (about 10 tablespoons; 140g)
1/2 ounce malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farm (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
5 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon, spooned; 140g)","1.
Toast the Sugar: Place sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet, then transfer to a cold oven and set oven to 350°F (180°C). Meanwhile, brown butter according to the step below; by the time it is finished, the sugar should be lightly toasted and beginning to smell of caramel. Pour warm sugar into a 2-quart glass baking dish (or similar dish) to speed cooling and let it cool to approximately 75°F (24°C). The prepared sugar can be used as soon as the brown butter has fully cooled, or it can be stored in an airtight container indefinitely.
2.
Brown the Butter: In a 2-quart stainless steel saucier, melt butter over medium-low heat. Increase heat to medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. Adjust heat as needed so that the dairy solids will not scorch before all the water can boil away. Continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form along the way, until the butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (an indication that the water has completely boiled away). Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer, along with all the toasty brown bits, and cool until creamy, opaque, and no warmer than 75°F (24°C). Alternatively, the brown butter can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks, then softened to the same temperature before use.
3.
Make the Dough: When the brown butter is creamy and thick, add the cooled toasted sugar, malted milk powder, vanilla extract, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix on low until combined, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and light. Reduce speed to low, then add flour and continue mixing only until well combined.
4.
Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula to make sure there are no streaks of unmixed dough, then knead lightly against sides of bowl. Transfer to a sheet of parchment paper and shape into a rough log about 12 inches in length.
5.
Fold parchment over dough, then use a bench scraper to tuck parchment under dough; gently pull on top sheet of parchment to tighten the log. Move the bench scraper down a few inches and repeat, until the log is smooth and tight all around. Roll dough so it wraps up in the parchment, cut away the excess, and secure with a piece of tape. Tie off the ends with pieces of twine. Refrigerate until dough is chilled to about 40°F (4°C), about 4 hours; dough can also be held in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
6.
To Bake: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, preheat to 350°F (180°C), and set chilled dough out at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften. Using a sharp chef's knife, cut dough log into rounds just shy of 1/2 inch. Arrange on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool completely before serving. Stored in an airtight container, the shortbread cookies will keep for several weeks at cool room temperature.

Lemon-Ricotta Cheesecake Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
This is, first and foremost, a lemon cheesecake—its bold flavor originating with grated lemon zest and essential oil working in tandem, with the zippy brightness of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and the mellow citrus fragrance of orange blossom water to tie everything together. Underneath it all, a combination of cream cheese and ricotta make the cheesecake itself tangy, light, and rich (but not overly so).
Other citrus cheesecakes, whether orange, bergamot, or key lime, are no more complicated than swapping one ingredient for its equivalent; for more on sourcing obscure essential oils, see our guide to essential oils, extracts, and flower waters.","Yield:Makes one 8- by 4-inch round cheesecake, or about 16 slices
Active time: About 30 minutes
Total time:About 13 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Graham Cracker Crust:
9 ounces fine cookie crumbs, store-bought or homemade, such as gingerbread, gingersnaps, or graham crackers, see note (about 2 cups; 250g)
1 ounce unsalted butter, melted (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)
Pinch of salt
For the Cheesecake:
24 ounces full-fat cream cheese, such as Philadelphia, brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 3 cups; 680g)
24 ounces fresh ricotta, strained if watery, brought to about 70°F/21°C, see note (about 3 cups; 680g)
10 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 1 1/2 cups; 280g)
1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)
1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest, not packed (about 5g)
1/2 teaspoon lemon oil or lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon orange flower water
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
8 large eggs (about 14 ounces; 395g)
To Serve:
candied lemon peel, blueberry jam, or other accompaniments, such as 1 recipe (about 1/2 cup) complementary Fruit Syrup or jelly, for saucing the fruit, optional","1.
Getting Ready: This recipe requires an 8- by 4-inch nonreactive aluminum pan, preferably a non-latching, two-piece style, such as this one. Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, target temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments, which have not been tested here.
2.
If using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan.
3.
For the Crust: Add the cookie crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan. The mixture may seem drier than you might expect, but it will absorb moisture from the cheesecake as it bakes.
4.
For the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 225°F. Combine cream cheese, ricotta, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, lemon oil, orange flower water, and salt in the bowl of a 14-cup food processor and process until smooth, pausing to scrape the bowl as needed to dislodge any pieces of cream cheese that do not initially incorporate. Once smooth, add the eggs and process only until well combined. Use immediately or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Please note that the volume of batter will overwhelm mini-choppers as well as food processors with a ""thick liquid"" max-fill line of less than 10-cups; if this equipment is not available, the ingredients will need to be combined by hand or with great care on a stand mixer to avoid over-aeration.
5.
Pour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles in the batter. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone.
6.
Bake until the cheesecake feels firm around the edges, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble when you shake the pan. This softer zone should be no more than 3 inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 155°F on a digital thermometer inserted into the very center of the cheesecake. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more. In an accurate oven, with an 8- by 4-inch aluminum pan, the cheesecake will bake in about 3 1/2 hours. Please be aware the bake time will vary, perhaps substantially, according to the accuracy of the oven's temperature, pan style, batter temperature, and other factors. Cool the cheesecake at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.
7.
Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose-Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4 inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.
8.
Unmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface and then invert onto a large, flat plate. Lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.
9.
To Serve: Top with candied lemon rind, jam, or homemade fruit syrup. Cut the cheesecake with a large chef's knife dipped in hot water; for clean and tidy portions of cheesecake, pause to clean the blade under hot running water between each slice.

"Deep-Fried, Sous Vide, 36-Hour, All-Belly Porchetta Recipe",,"Note: Herbs and aromatics can be substituted or altered according to taste. I find it easiest to work with a whole belly at a time and if a smaller roast is desired, to split it in half and freeze half while still raw. Wrapped tightly in foil and plastic wrap, it should last for several months in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and proceed with cooking steps as instructed.
If your sous-vide oven and wok aren't big enough, you can split the porchetta crosswise into two pieces before vacuum sealing and cook them side-by side. Deep fry them one at a time, holding the first in a 200°F oven on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet while the second one cooks.
For a full photographic walkthrough of the process, click here.","Yield:12 to 15
Active time: 2 hours
Total time:3 days
Rated: 4","Ingredients
1 whole boneless, rind-on pork belly, about 12 to 15 pounds
2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
3 tablespoons whole fennel seed
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper
3 tablespoons finely chopped rosemary, sage, or thyme leaves
12 cloves garlic, grated on a microplane grater
Kosher salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 quarts peanut oil, lard, or a mixture (canola or vegetable oil will do fine)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter","1.
Place pork belly skin-side down on a large cutting board. Using a sharp chef's knife, score flesh at an angle using strokes about 1-inch apart. Rotate knife 90 degrees and repeat to create a diamond pattern in the flesh.
2.
Toast peppercorns and fennel seed in a small skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind until roughly crushed.
3.
Season pork liberally with salt then sprinkle with crushed pepper and fennel, red pepper, chopped herbs, and microplaned garlic. Use your hands to rub the mixture deeply into the cracks and crevices in the meat.
4.
Roll belly into a tight log and push to top of cutting board, seam-side down. Cut 12 to 18 lengths of kitchen twine long enough to tie around the pork and lay them down in regular intervals along your cutting board, about 1-inch apart each. Lay rolled pork seam-side down on top of strings. Working from the outermost strings towards the center, tie up roast tightly. Combine 2 tablespoons kosher salt with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Rub mixture over entire surface of porchetta.
5.
If roast is too large and unwieldy, carefully slice in half with a sharp chef's knife. Seal in individual vacuum-sealed pouches and refrigerate at least overnight and up to three days. If desired, porchetta can also be frozen at this point for future use (see note)
6.
Preheat sous-vide water cooker to 155°F (68.3°C). Add pork and cook for 36 hours. Transfer pork to a sink filled with ice water and chill for 15 minutes. Remove from bag then carefully peel off congealed exuded cooking liquid and place in a medium saucepan.
7.
Rinse porchetta under hot running water until all excess fat and congealed juices are cleared from surface, then carefully dry with paper towels.
8.
Heat oil over high heat in a large wok or Dutch oven to 400°F. Carefully slide pork into oil using spatulas and tongs. (It will not be fully submerged). Immediately cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally until sputtering dies a bit, about 2 minutes. Adjust flame to maintain consistent 350°F temperature. Using a large metal ladle, spoon hot oil over the exposed portions of the roast continuously until the bottom half is cooked and crisp, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook on second side, basting the whole time.
9.
Remove porchetta to a large paper towel-lined plate and blot all over. Season with salt. Let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat bag juices over medium-high heat until simmering. Add the butter and swirl until smooth. If center of pork is still hot, carve and serve immediately. Otherwise, transfer to a 250°F oven until warmed through, then serve.

Yeasted Blini Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
These light and delicious Russian blini are leavened with yeast, which adds a complex tangy flavor and airy texture. Unlike many yeasted blini recipes, this one calls for only a single fermentation, saving you time without sacrificing results. (We know, because we tested it both ways.) Softly beaten egg whites, meanwhile, add even more lightness to the batter. The result is a perfect platform on which to heap sour cream (or crème fraîche) and caviar.","Yield:Makes about 50 small blini
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes
Rated: 4.5","Ingredients
2 cups (475ml) whole milk
1 packet active dry yeast (1/4 ounce; 7g)
2 teaspoons (8g) sugar, divided
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces; 215g), divided
1/2 teaspoon (2g) kosher salt
2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil, plus more for cooking
2 large eggs (110g), separated
Sour cream or crème fraîche, for serving
Chilled caviar or smoked salmon, for serving
Finely minced shallots, sliced chives, and/or chopped hard-boiled eggs, for serving (optional)","1.
In a small saucepan, bring milk to a simmer over medium-high heat. Transfer milk to a large heatproof bowl and let cool until it registers between 105°F (41°C) and 115°F (46°C).
2.
Add yeast and 1 teaspoon (4g) sugar to bowl of warm milk and let sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should froth and foam. (If it doesn't, this likely means your yeast has expired; buy a new packet before making this recipe.) Add half of flour (3/4 cup; 4 ounces; 113g) and whisk mixture until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot until mixture has approximately doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3.
Add remaining 3/4 cup flour (4 ounces; 113g) and 1 teaspoon (4g) sugar, as well as salt, melted butter, vegetable oil, and egg yolks. Whisk until ingredients are well incorporated but batter is still slightly lumpy.
4.
In a small bowl using a whisk, or using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold egg whites into batter until just combined.
5.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 150°F (66°C) or its lowest possible setting. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle set to 350°F/177°C). Add a small amount of vegetable oil to the skillet and spread with a paper towel until no visible oil remains. Using a spoon, place silver dollar pancake–sized circles of batter (about 2 1/2 inches in diameter) in the skillet. Cook until the bubbles that appear on the surface of the blini stop being reabsorbed into the batter and remain distinct, and bottom sides of blini are light golden brown, about 2 minutes.
6.
Carefully flip blini and cook on second side until light golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Wrap finished blini in a clean kitchen towel, place towel on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat blini-cooking process until all of the batter is used up.
7.
Serve blini with sour cream or crème fraîche, chilled caviar or smoked salmon, and traditional accompaniments, such as finely minced shallots, sliced chives, and chopped hard-boiled eggs.

Made with plenty of egg yolks, spices, and pumpkin purée, this light and fluffy cake has all the depth and flavor of a classic pumpkin pie. A generous layer of tangy cream cheese buttercream offsets the hearty cake, while a scattering of toasted pecans adds a welcome dose of flavor and crunch.
Adapted from BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts with permission from W. W. Norton.","Yield:Serves 14
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:3 1/2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Cake:
8 ounces unsalted butter (about 2 sticks; 225g), softened to about 70°F (21°C)
14 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 2 cups; 395g)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon potato flour, such as Bob's Red Mill (not potato flakes or starch; see note)
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
5 ounces organic egg yolk (about 1/2 cup; 140g), from about 8 large eggs, brought to about 70°F (21°C)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
3 ounces milk, brought to about 70°F/21°C (about 1/3 cup; 85g), any percentage will do
12 ounces pumpkin or butternut squash purée (about 1 1/3 cups; 340g), canned or homemade
13 1/2 ounces bleached cake flour (about 3 1/3 cups, spooned; 385g), such as Swans Down
To Finish:
1 recipe Cream Cheese Buttercream
Ground cinnamon, to taste (optional)
5 ounces toasted pecan pieces (about 1 cup; 140g), optional","1.
Getting Ready: To better synchronize the downtime in both recipes, prepare the Cream Cheese Buttercream before the cake. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease two 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here).
2.
For the Cake: Combine butter, sugar, baking powder, potato flour, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and cream until the mixture is fluffy, light, and soft, about 8 minutes, pausing to scrape bowl and beater halfway through. With mixer running, add egg yolks one at a time, followed by vanilla. Take care not to overbeat at this stage.
3.
Meanwhile, combine milk and pumpkin purée and whisk until smooth. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in a third of the cake flour, followed by a third of the pumpkin/milk mixture. Alternate between the two, allowing each addition to roughly incorporate before adding the next. Once batter is smooth, fold with a flexible spatula to ensure it’s well mixed from the bottom up. Divide between prepared cake pans, adding just about 27 ounces (756g) to each one.
4.
Bake until cakes are well risen and firm to the touch, about 35 minutes or to 200°F (93°C). A toothpick inserted into the center will have a few crumbs still attached. Cool until no trace of warmth remains, about 2 hours due to the cakes' thickness. Run a butter knife around edges to loosen, then invert cakes onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and return cakes right side up. (Covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours.)
5.
For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here) and set scraps aside for snacking. (These can also be crumbled into a batch of freshly churned Buttermilk Ice Cream.) Place 1 layer on a heavy cast iron turntable; if you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with second layer, then cover sides of cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (watch our crumb-coating tutorial for more info). Refrigerate cake until buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.
6.
Re-whip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to decorate chilled cake as desired; finish with a sprinkling of cinnamon and toasted pecans, if desired. Let cake return to cool room temperature before serving. Cut with a chef’s knife to serve and cover exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.

Chinese Fried Pork and Cabbage Dumplings With Homemade Wrappers (guo tie) Recipe,,"Nice fatty pork keeps things moist, while cabbage acts much in the way that breadcrumbs work in meatloaf or meatballs: it physically impedes the pork muscly proteins from binding too tightly with each other, ensuring that the filling stays tender without shrinking. How many times have you bitten into a restaurant dumpling only to find a big empty sack of skin with a tiny meat nugget hiding out in the corner? That won't happen with these.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 1 1/2 hours
Total time:1 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.3333333333333","Ingredients
For the Dough:
2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
1 cup boiling water
For the Filling:
1/2 pound napa cabbage (about 1/2 a small head), roughly chopped
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 scallions, roughly chooped
1/2 pound fatty ground pork
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
2 teaspoons sugar
For the Dipping Sauce:
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Chinkiang vinegar (or rice vinegar)
1 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon finely sliced scallion greens
1 teaspoon ginger, grated on a microplane
To Cook:
Vegetable oil","1.
For the Dough: place flour in bowl of food processor. With machine running, slowly drizzle in water until cohesive dough is formed (you probably won't need all the water). All dough to ride around processor for 30 seconds. Form into a ball using floured hands and transfer to a bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for at least 30 minutes.
2.
For the filling: Place cabbage and salt in food processor and pulse until finely chopped, about 10 one-second pulses. Transfer to a fine-meshed strainer set over a bowl. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place scallions, pork, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and sugar in bowl of food processor. Pulse until homogeneous and pasty, about 10 one-second pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.
3.
After cabbage has purged, squeeze any remaining moisture out with your fingers, then transfer to the bowl with the pork. Fold together with a spatula until homogeneous. Microwave a small ball of the filling in a bowl for 10 seconds and eat it to taste for seasoning. Add more salt, soy sauce, or sugar as necessary and repeat tasting/seasoning step until the filling tastes like you want it to. Refrigerate until ready to use.
4.
To Make the Dumplings: Divide dough into 4 sections, and each section into 10 small tablespoon-sized balls, making 40 balls total. On a well-floured work surface, roll each ball into a round 3 1/2- to 4-inches in diameter. Stack wrappers and keep under plastic until all of them are rolled out.
5.
To form dumplings, place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of a wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a wet fingertip or a pastry brush. Fold in half and pinch the bottom-right corner closed. Pleat the front edge of the wrapper repeatedly, pinching the edge closed after each pleat until the entire dumpling is sealed. Transfer sealed dumplings to a lightly floured wooden or parchment-lined board.
6.
To Make the Sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside at room temperature.
7.
To Cook the Dumplings: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a 6 to 12 dumplings and boil until they float (About 1 minute). Continue boiling for 2 minutes longer, then transfer to a plate with a wire-mesh spider or slotted spoon. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet or the bottom of a well-seasoned cast iron wok over medium heat until shimmering. Add dumplings flat-side down and cook, swirling occasionally, until bottom of dumplings are golden brown and crisp. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.

Rotisserie Turkey Recipe,,"Smoked turkeys are so juicy and flavorful, they put oven-roasted birds to shame. Ever since getting a smoker, no turkey has been cooked using any other method in my house. There's one big catch though—the smoke leaves the skin tough and leathery, and although I've known a few people willing to exert the extra effort needed to eat it, for the most part, I consider it inedible.
With the addition of a rotisserie to my arsenal, I could finally fix this conundrum and get an extremely flavorful bird with some self basting rotisserie action, and a delicious skin by avoiding the use of smoke.
After an incredibly successful turkey at last year's Thanksgiving using Alton Brown's recipe (which I know many of you use too) I gave this one the same initial treatment: brined in a mixture of salt, vegetable stock, pepper, allspice, and candied ginger, then stuffed with some aromatics before cooking. It then went onto the spit and slowly turned until the breast meat hit 165°F.
While I was right on with the skin, which turned out undeniably delicious, the meat did not quite live up to my standards set by the smoker. It still beat out the oven-roasted version in terms of juiciness and overall taste, but it lacked that little extra imparted by the smoke which raises a turkey to great new heights, leaving me a new challenge for next year: smoked rotisserie turkey!
Adapted from Alton Brown.",,"Ingredients
1 natural turkey about 12 to 14 pounds
For the Brine
1 cup kosher salt
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 gallon vegetable stock
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 1/2 teaspoons allspice berries
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped candied ginger
1 gallon ice cold water

1 red apple, sliced
1/2 onion, sliced
1 cinnamon stick
1 cup water
4 sprigs rosemary
6 leaves sage
Type of fire: three-zone split
Grill heat: medium","1.
Bring vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and candied ginger to a boil in large stockpot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve solids. Remove from heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate to 40°F.
2.
In large non-reactive container, combine brine with cold water. Set turkey in brine, breast side down, placinga weight on top to keep turkey submerged if necessary. Place in refrigerator and let brine for 8 to 16 hours.
3.
Remove turkey from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Place turkey on rack over rimmed baking sheet and allow to air-dry overnight in refrigerator. (This step is optional, but will result in a crisper skin.)
4.
Combine apple, onion, cinnamon, and water in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add to turkey's cavity, along with rosemary and sage. Close turkey cavity by threading wooden skewer through flaps of skin. Fold wings under body and tie legs together. Allow turkey to come to room temperature while you prepare grill.
5.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on either side of charcoal grate. Place foil pan between two piles of coals to capture drippings to serve with turkey or to make gravy. Place turkey on rotisserie and cook over medium heat until instant read thermometer registers 155°F in thickest part of the breast, 2 to 3 hours. Remove turkey from rotisserie and let rest for 20 minutes, carve and serve.

Lentil and Chestnut Soup Recipe,,"[Photograph: Nick Kindelsperger]
Chestnuts are usually the enemy of a quick meal. Roasting them and then removing their tough skins can take ages, especially if you're not particularly skilled at the process (like me). So I would have normally skipped right past this soup from Nigella Lawson's How To Eat if it hadn't called for canned chestnuts, which, it turns out, require absolutely no prep work. I can't comment on whether they taste as wonderful as the regular variety, but they sure do work well here.
Part of the success of the soup also comes from the red lentils, which are cooked until nearly falling apart. They look a little worn out by the end, but that doesn't matter much considering you're going to puree everything up at the end. The result is a creamy, slightly nutty soup that's more more complex than it looks. The cream sounds superfluous, but the contrast of the warm pureed soup and the cool cream works extremely well.","Yield:serves 4 to 6

Pour the oil into a large Dutch oven set over medium heat. When warm, add the minced onion, leek, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften but don't brown.

Carefully puree the soup in a blender. (You'll probably have to do this in batches.) When done, return the soup to the pot to warm it back up. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with a sprinkling of parsley and a drizzle of heavy cream.

1 quart Hearty Vegetable Stock (4 cups; 960ml) (see note)
1/4 cup (57g) minced fresh parsley leaves, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions. Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven heat to 350°F (177°C).
2.
Place half of mushrooms in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until roughly chopped, about 8 short pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with remaining mushrooms. Place pecan halves in food processor (do not wipe out bowl) and process until roughly chopped, about 12 short pulses. Set aside.
3.
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until all moisture has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add half of sage and continue to cook, stirring, until mushrooms are well browned, about 5 minutes longer.

Simple Pear Galette With Vanilla Recipe,,"[Photograph and video: Vicky Wasik]
Sweet and mellow pears require a delicate touch to bring out their best, which is why I rely on subtle aromatics, like vanilla bean, Chinese five-spice powder, and ground cardamom, to complement their natural flavor. A spoonful of apple cider vinegar cuts through the fruit's simple sweetness with an equally autumnal aroma. To keep the pears tender rather than mushy, try varieties like Bosc and Seckel, or slightly underripe Anjous (whether red or green).","Yield:Serves 6

1 1/4 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 3 tablespoons; 35g)
3/4 ounce tapioca starch (about 3 tablespoons; 20g)
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
26 ounces crisp, semi-tart pears, such as Bosc or Seckel (about 3 large pears; 735g)
1/2 ounce apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon; 15g)
For the Egg Wash:
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1/2 ounce heavy cream (1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
Prepare Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough, at least 2 hours or up to 24.
2.
For the Filling: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C). In a medium bowl, rub vanilla seeds into sugar, then whisk in tapioca starch, salt, Chinese five-spice powder, and cardamom. Reserve vanilla pod for another use.
3.
Wash pears (no need to peel), then quarter, core, and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Measure 20 ounces of pears (about 3 heaping cups; 565g) into the bowl of spiced vanilla sugar, drizzle with apple cider vinegar, and toss until sugar has dissolved.
4.
Arrange pears over chilled dough in a roughly 10-inch ring, tiling the slices like dominoes. Drizzle any remaining liquid from filling over fruit. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold dough over pears, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Refrigerate galette and prepare the egg wash.
5.
For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, egg yolk, cream, and salt in a small bowl. Brush over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together.
6.
Bake until galette is golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 35 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve warm, with dollops of whipped cream if desired.

Borrowing from the Mexican pantry, this easy, warming soup is made with roasted butternut squash, flavored with ancho chilies, and garnished with Mexican crema, cilantro, and pepitas. If butternut squash soup and chili had a lovechild, this might be it.
Why this recipe works:
Roasting the squash first deepens its flavor and sweetness.
Ancho chilies add a rich, earthy taste and mild heat to the soup.
Note: If you want a less spicy soup with a less intense chili flavor, feel free to discard the ancho chili seeds or scale down to 1 ancho chili pepper. Otherwise, go for the big flavor and spoon in plenty of crema or sour cream to tame the intensity.

3.
Using butcher's twine, secure the package at 1- to 2-inch intervals, tying as tightly as possible.
4.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate.
5.
Place beef directly on coals. Partially cover grill and cook for 10 minutes. Flip beef and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the package registers 95°F for rare or 105°F for medium-rare. (I do not advise cooking for longer than that if you want juicy meat.) Transfer the whole package to a metal tray or pan and let rest until the core reaches 120°F for rare or 130°F for medium-rare, about 10 to 20 minutes.
6.
When ready to serve, carefully crack open the crust with the back of a knife, reserve some of the smoky salt for serving, and discard the burnt cloth and remaining salt. Use the back of your knife or a pastry brush to remove any excess salt. Slice tenderloin and serve with ají or chimichurri as desired.

Pumpkin Cheesecake With Gingersnap Crust Recipe,,"One of my favorite seasonal desserts is pumpkin cheesecake, despite the abundance of its variations and oversaturation of the market with all things pumpkin-and-spice. Ginger snap and brown sugar crust and homemade candied nuts (with a thin coating of toasted sugar and spices that shatter at first bite) are what you can expect in my rendition. You'd be a blockhead not to try it.
Notes:
It is crucial that the cream cheese be completely softened—firm cream cheese will not produce a smooth batter.
I prefer standard pumpkin purée over organic for this recipe—I found it richer in flavor and more concentrated in color.
Don't be alarmed: the cheesecake will shrink as it cools.","Yield:serves 10
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:6 hours","Ingredients
For the Crust
2 1/2 cups ginger snap cookie crumbs (from a 16-ounce box)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled

Lacy Brown Butter and Ricotta Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
These thin and lacy cookies are oh-so-slightly crisp around the edges, with chewy middles that are nutty and rich—eating them is like mainlining brown butter. The secret to their incredible texture is ricotta, which helps the cookies bubble and spread as they bake.","Yield:About 35 (3-inch) cookies
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:Up to 2 hours
Rated: 4.75","Ingredients
5 ounces unsalted butter (about 10 tablespoons; 140g)
1 leftover vanilla bean pod, optional (see this article on working with leftover vanilla)
7 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 1 cup; 195g)
2 teaspoons (10g) vanilla extract
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon (1.25g) baking soda
4 ounces cold ricotta (about 1/2 cup; 110g), strained if watery (see note)
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)","1.
Getting Ready: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat. When it has completely melted, add vanilla pod (if using) and increase heat to medium. Simmer, stirring and scraping with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. When butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent, remove from heat and pour into a medium bowl, making sure to scrape up all the toasty brown bits from along the bottom. Cool until slightly thickened and opaque, but still slightly warm, around 80°F (27°C). This will take about 75 minutes at room temperature or 25 minutes in the fridge; if refrigerating, stir butter every 6 minutes or so to prevent it from hardening around the edges of the bowl.
2.
Make the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). When brown butter has cooled, remove vanilla pod (if using) and stir in sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda. Stir until baking soda is well distributed, about 1 minute, then fold in cold ricotta. Once ingredients are combined, stir in flour to form a soft dough.
3.
Portioning the Dough: Divide into 1-tablespoon portions and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving about 4 inches between cookies to account for their significant spread. (If you like, the dough can be placed on a parchment-lined plate and frozen until firm, then transferred to a zip-top bag for storage. It can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.)
4.
Bake until cookies are lacy, thin, and golden brown around the edges, but still rather pale in the middle, about 12 minutes. Cool completely on baking sheet, as the cookies will be doughy and soft while warm. Enjoy after cooling, or store up to 1 week in an airtight container at room temperature.

Hummus Masabacha (Hummus With Whole Chickpeas) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Hummus masabacha is a popular variant of the Middle Eastern chickpea spread in which most or all of the chickpeas are left whole and tossed with the tahini sauce, instead of being puréed into it. There are endless variations on it, but at its heart, it's as easy as can be, and lots more interesting than your average hummus spread.","Yield:Makes about 5 cups, serving 8 to 10
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:2 hours 15 minutes, plus overnight soak
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1/2 pound dried chickpeas (about 1 1/4 level cups; 225g)
2 teaspoons (12g) baking soda, divided
Kosher salt
1 small onion, split in half
1 small stalk celery
1 small carrot
2 medium cloves garlic
2 bay leaves
1 sprig rosemary (optional)
1 to 1 1/2 cups (235 to 350ml) Tahini Sauce With Garlic and Lemon
1/3 cup (50g) minced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems
Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving
Za'atar, paprika, toasted pine nuts, and/or chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)
Warm pita bread, for serving","1.
Combine chickpeas, 1 teaspoon (6g) baking soda, and 2 tablespoons (24g) salt in a large bowl. Cover with 6 cups (1.4L) cold water. Stir to dissolve salt and baking soda. Let stand at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse chickpeas thoroughly.
2.
Place chickpeas in a large Dutch oven or saucepan. Add remaining baking soda, 1 tablespoon (12g) salt, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaves, and rosemary, if using. Add 6 cups (1.4L) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and cook until chickpeas are completely tender and nearly falling apart, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Check on chickpeas occasionally and top up with more water if necessary; they should be completely submerged at all times. Let cool slightly.
3.
Discard onion, garlic, celery, carrot, bay leaves, and rosemary. Drain chickpeas, reserving their cooking water.
4.
In a blender or food processor, combine 1 cup (235ml) tahini sauce with about one-quarter of the cooked chickpeas and blend until very smooth, with a thick but pourable milkshake-like consistency. Thin with a little of the reserved cooking liquid if necessary (but be careful not to thin too much at once; you can always thin more, but can't remove liquid once it's added). Season with salt.
5.
In a mixing bowl, combine tahini mixture with remaining chickpeas and parsley. Stir until thoroughly mixed and chickpeas are coated in a creamy sauce. (If you prefer the sauce thinner, gently work in a little more of the reserved cooking liquid.) You can refrigerate the hummus at this point; it will become thicker in the refrigerator.
6.
Spoon onto a serving dish, drizzle with olive oil, and top with garnishes of your choice. Serve with warm pita bread.

1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
15 large basil leaves, thinly sliced into a chiffonade
Red wine vinegar, to taste
Sugar, to taste
Freshly toasted sliced bread, for serving
Halved garlic cloves, for rubbing on toasts","1.
Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Working over a bowl, using your fingers, tear each tomato in half and press out and discard the seeds.

Transfer oven-roasted tomatoes to a work surface and chop finely. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and basil and stir well. Season with salt and add red wine vinegar, about 1 teaspoon at a time, until tomatoes are very lightly tart. Stir in a pinch of sugar to help pump up tomatoes' natural sweetness even more; add more sugar sparingly to taste, if desired.
3.
Rub top sides of toasts all over with garlic (rub more on for a stronger flavor, or less for a gentler one). Drizzle toasts with olive oil and season lightly with salt. Spoon tomatoes on top and serve.

Classic Mignonette Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Whether you think of it as a pickled shallot condiment or a vinegary sauce, classic mignonette is the perfect companion for oysters on the half-shell. When you are working with just three ingredients, it's important to treat them with care; simple food shouldn't be an afterthought.","Yield:Makes 1/2 cup
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 3","Ingredients
2 large shallots
1/2 cup (120ml) white wine vinegar (see note)
4 teaspoons (12g) whole black peppercorns","1.
Using a small, sharp knife, trim shallot ends, leaving root end attached. Cut shallots in half, peel and discard skins. Using your hands, remove the core from each shallot half, leaving layered petals of shallot. Set cores aside for another use.
2.
Cut shallot petals into pieces that can lie flat on the cutting board, and position them vertically on the board, with root ends farthest from you. Starting with the tip of your knife just below the root end, slice shallot petals into thin strips from pole to pole, leaving them barely attached at root end.
3.
Rotate shallot petals 90 degrees and cut across the thin strips to make very finely diced pieces. Using bench scraper, transfer minced shallots to small bowl; discard root end scraps. Pour vinegar over shallots, and set bowl aside.
4.
In a small skillet over medium heat, toast peppercorns until fragrant and warm to the touch, shaking skillet occasionally to ensure that they toast evenly and don't burn, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer peppercorns to small bowl and let them cool for 1 minute.
5.
Crack peppercorns into rough halves and quarters. You can use a mortar and pestle; or a large mallet, meat pounder, or the bottom of a skillet or saucepan to crush them (doing this in a rimmed baking sheet, or wrapping the peppercorns in a clean kitchen towel, will help contain them).
6.
Add cracked peppercorns to bowl with shallots and vinegar, and stir to combine. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour to allow flavors to marry. If you are not planning to serve immediately, transfer mignonette to the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to 3 days. Serve with oysters on the half-shell.

Assorted raw vegetables, such as radishes, cauliflower florets, cardoon stalks (trimmed of long fibers), bell peppers, endive leaves, and more, cut for dipping
1 whole, skin-on yellow onion, roasted in a 400°F (200°C) oven until tender throughout, then peeled and cut for dipping (optional)","1.
Trim garlic cloves; if desired, halve lengthwise and remove germ from center. (Very developed green germs can add a subtle bitterness to the sauce, though our tests with younger garlic showed no noticeable difference between batches made with and without a more beige germ.) Slice garlic.
2.
In a small saucepan, combine garlic and milk or water, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook until garlic is soft, about 10 minutes.
3.
Drain garlic well. Wipe out saucepan, then return garlic to saucepan and cover with olive oil. Cook over very low heat until garlic is very soft and can easily be smashed with a wooden spoon, about 10 minutes.
4.
Add anchovies and cook, stirring and smashing, until they have fully dissolved into the sauce. Continue smashing the garlic and anchovies until a thick purée forms. (If desired, you can very quickly purée the bagna càuda with an immersion blender to make an even smoother sauce.)

1 ounce cocoa nibs, from brands such as Healthworks (about 1/4 cup; 30g), plus more for garnishing (optional)","1.
In a 1-quart stainless steel saucier, melt cocoa butter over medium-low heat, stirring frequently with a flexible spatula to speed the process along. When cocoa butter is fully melted, pour into the bowl of a stand mixer and cool to approximately 90°F (32°C). Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
2.
When cocoa butter has cooled, add sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and butter. Fit mixer with a paddle attachment and cream until mixture is fluffy and light, about 3 minutes. With mixer still running, add egg, followed by vanilla, and continue beating just until well combined. Pause to scrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Add flour; once combined, shut off mixer and fold in chocolate and cocoa nibs (if using).
3.
Using a cookie scoop or scale, divide dough into 28 portions (about 2 tablespoons, 1 1/2 ounces, or 40g each). If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen 3 months; soften to about 68°F (20°C) before baking.
4.
Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving about 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Without flattening the portions, top each with a few extra portions of chocolate and cocoa nibs and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of kosher salt. Bake until puffed and firm around the edges, though rather pale overall, about 15 minutes. (Due to their low lactose content, these cookies will not brown as you might expect. When fully baked, they will still be quite pale but crisp around the edges.) Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Store in an airtight container up to 4 days at room temperature.

"Red Wine-Marinated, Roasted Beef Tenderloin With Herb-Horseradish Cream Recipe",,"Red wine and herb-marinated beef tenderloin is a company-worthy dish served drizzled with pan sauce, alongside herbaceous horseradish cream. [Photograph: Jennifer Olvera]
The first time I made this dish was for Christmas dinner, and it was an instant hit. Who can resist buttery-tender beef tenderloin with a red wine marinade and not one, but two sauces: a pan sauce made with the drippings and extra marinade, and a parsley, dill, and mint-flecked horseradish cream?
Why this recipe works:
Beef tenderloin, a lean and non-marbled cut, benefits from a flavorful marinade that's repurposed as a pan sauce.
Searing the meat before it's finished in a high oven gives it a nicely browned crust while keeping the lean meat moist and juicy inside.
A bright, creamy, herb-laden horseradish cream adds an extra layer of flavor and richness.
Note: The horseradish cream sauce may be made and refrigerated for up to four hours ahead.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12

3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
4 teaspoons fresh dill, divided use
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup homemade or store-bought low-sodium beef or chicken stock
2 tablespoons butter
For the Herb-Horseradish Cream:
1 1/2 cups sour cream
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 teaspoons minced fresh mint leaves","1.
Place trimmed beef tenderloin in a resealable bag. Add wine, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, oregano, thyme, 2 teaspoons dill and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Seal, squish around to combine and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 to 6 hours.
2.
When ready to cook, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Remove meat from the refrigerator and pat dry with paper towels.
3.
Season meat with salt and pepper. Fold small end of tenderloin back on itself by a few inches to create an even thickness. Secure meat with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals to create an evenly sized roast.
4.
Heat 1 ½ tablespoons oil in a large, oven-safe roasting pan or Dutch oven until shimmering. Sear meat until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Add marinade to the pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Transfer meat to the oven to cook until meat reaches an internal temperature of 125°F as registered on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, 20 to 30 minutes.
5.
Remove meat from the oven, transfer to a platter and allow to rest for 10 minutes. While the meat is resting, deglaze the pan on the stove top over medium-high heat, adding beef broth and scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Swirl in butter to finish the sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.
6.
In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, horseradish, parsley, mint, remaining 2 teaspoons dill and remaining 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

Parker House Rolls Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Parker house rolls are typically soft, sweet, buttery, and folded over. Some folks like them nestled together in the pan so they touch each other, while others prefer them kept separated. You can decide that when you bake them.
Instant mashed potato flakes are my secret ingredient for making breads fluffy. When you buy them, look for the ones that are nothing but dried potatoes—no added salt, spices, or preservatives.
I normally use my stand mixer for kneading bread dough, but most can be kneaded by hand. In theory, you could knead this one by hand, but keep in mind the dough is pretty stiff in the beginning and hard to knead, and that incorporating the butter by hand isn't a whole lot of fun
Then again, these rolls are worth it.
Note: The milk shouldn't be hot for this bread—just at that point of warm when you realize it's not chilled any more. 30 seconds or so in the microwave is just about enough. If it still seems chilly, microwave in short increments, until it feels just warm—not hot.","Yield:Makes 12 rolls
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:2 hours, 25 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 1/4 cups (about 10 ounces) warm milk
2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
11 1/4 ounces (about 2 1/4 cups) bread flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup instant mashed potato flakes
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature
1 teaspoon salt","1.
Put the milk, yeast, bread flour, sugar, and potato flakes in the bowl of your stand mixer. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. The dough will be quite stiff at this point.
2.
Add the butter and salt and continue kneading until the butter is completely incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside until the dough has doubled in size, about an hour.
3.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Turn out the dough, pat it down to flatten it. Fold the left side towards the middle, then the top, then the right side, and the bottom to form a rough square.
4.
With a rolling pin, roll the dough to about 9 by 12 inches. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough into three 12-inch strips, then cut each strip into 4 equal pieces, so you have 12 squares.
5.
Using a chopstick, the handle of a wooden spoon, or a similar object, press a line onto each square going straight across (not diagonally) so it's not quite across the center of the square. This will help keep the dough from unfolding when it bakes. Fold the dough over at the crease, with the larger portion folded over the smaller one, like a clam with an overbite.
6.
Arrange the folded dough on the baking sheet, leaving space between them if you don't want them to touch, or placing them nearly touching if you prefer pull-apart buns. Cover the buns with plastic wrap and set aside until doubled in size, half the time it took for the first rise (about 30 minutes).
7.
When the buns have doubled in size, bake at 350°F until the buns are nicely browned, about 25 minutes. Remove the buns from the pan and let them cool on a rack. Serve the same day.

White Wine and Mustard Gravy Recipe,,"A basic gravy gets a mellow mustard bite that goes incredibly well with roast or smoked turkey. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
We've got a whole slew of smoked and grilled turkey recipes on the site, but I'd never considered what it would take to make a gravy that would bring out their best attributes. Here, I take a basic turkey gravy in a bold direction by adding white wine and a combo of whole grain and Dijon mustards, balanced with a touch of honey to create a gravy that has undercurrents of a mustard barbecue sauce but fits right into a more traditional holiday meal.
Why this recipe works:
Butter and flour cooked together create a roux that thickens the turkey stock
White wine gives this gravy a dry fruity flavor with a little tanginess
Whole grain mustard adds texture, while a tablespoon of Dijon delivers most of the mustardy bite
A little honey adds a sweet undertone that contrasts and balances the more prominent mustard flavor","Yield:Makes about 3 cups

4 tablespoons (half stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup finely minced shallots
1/4 cup flour
3 cups turkey drippings or stock
1 cup white wine
2 tablespoon whole grain mustard
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Melt butter over medium high heat in medium saucepan. When foaming subsides, add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
2.
Whisk in flour and cook, stirring frequently, until golden blonde, about 2 minutes.

Gradually add in turkey drippings or stock and wine in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until reduced to 3 cups, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.

Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 recipe Southern-Style Unsweetened Cornbread (about 2 1/2 pounds; 1 1/4 kilograms), cut into 3/4-inch dice
1 stick unsalted butter (113 grams), plus more for greasing dish
1 pound (500 grams) sweet Italian sausage, removed from casing
1 large onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups; 300 grams)
2 large stalks celery, finely chopped (about 1 cup; 200 grams)
1/2 medium fennel bulb, finely chopped (about 1 cup; 200 grams)
2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 10 grams)
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
3 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium broth (700 milliliters), divided
4 large eggs
2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon leaves
1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley leaves (about 1/4 ounce; 8 grams), divided
2 cups raw oysters and their liquor (470 milliliters; about 32 medium oysters), oysters chopped (see note)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions. Preheat oven to 425°F. Spread cornbread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger sheets on oven racks and bake until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
2.
In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, about 2 minutes, without allowing butter to brown. Add sausage and mash with stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery, fennel, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.
3.
Whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, tarragon, and 3 tablespoons parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add cornbread cubes, oysters, and oyster liquor and fold gently until evenly mixed. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
4.
Transfer dressing to a buttered 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish or 10- by 14-inch oval dish. The dressing can be covered with aluminum foil and refrigerated for up to 2 days at this point (the flavor will improve as it sits). When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375°F. Uncover dressing and bake until an instant-read thermometer reads 150°F when inserted into center of dish and dressing is crisped on top, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.

","Juicy turkey with sweet smoke and a spice rub. [Photographs: J. Kenji López-Alt]
Turkey and smoke are a natural pairing, as anyone who's looked at a deli case can tell you, but there's a difference between cold-cut smoked turkey, with its ham-like cured texture and questionable smoke flavor, and real barbecued turkey. I'm talking the kind of smoked turkey you want served in thick, glistening slabs that are shiny with juice and fork-tender, with deep smoke flavor.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:4 hours, plus up to 3 days for dry-brining
Rated: 4","Ingredients
1 (10- to 12-pound; 4.5- to 6-kilogram) turkey
2 tablespoons (35 grams) kosher salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground yellow mustard seed
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seed
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon granulated garlic powder
1 teaspoon granulated onion powder
1 teaspoon ground sage
2 tablespoons (40 grams) light brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder","1.
At least 1 day and up to 3 days before cooking, remove the backbone from the turkey by cutting down either side of the spine with a pair of heavy-duty poultry shears. If necessary, use a cleaver or a heavy chef's knife to cut through the joints where the thigh meets the backbone. Alternatively, ask your butcher to butterfly your bird for you.
2.
Remove the wishbone by lifting the skin above the breast near the neck opening and locating the Y-shaped bone with your fingertip. Using a sharp paring knife, cut along the top and bottom of both halves of the bone. Slip your finger behind the bone, pull it out, and discard or save for gravy or stock.
3.
Lay the bird flat on a cutting board with its legs splayed out. Press down firmly on the breast to crack the bone so the turkey lies flat. Rub the skin all over with oil. Combine salt, paprika, smoked paprika, black pepper, mustard seed, coriander, cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, sage, brown sugar, and baking powder in a small bowl and mix until homogeneous. Rub mixture over entire surface of turkey, coating it thoroughly. Transfer turkey to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 3 days.
4.
When ready to cook, light one half chimney of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Place the turkey on the cooler side of the grill with the legs facing toward the coals. Add 4 wood chunks. Cover grill with lid vents directly over the turkey. Close bottom and top vents halfway.
5.
Cook turkey, adjusting vents to maintain a temperature between 225 and 275°F, adding fresh wood chunks every half hour and fresh coals a dozen at a time as necessary to maintain temperature. Cook until a probe thermometer inserted into the coolest part of the breast registers 150°F and the legs register at least 165°F, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. Remove turkey from grill, let rest 15 minutes, carve, and serve.

Miso-Squash Soup With Sesame-Ginger Apples Recipe,,"A creamy, savory, dairy-free squash soup. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Most soups based on squash aim to intensify its sweet flavors by first caramelizing its sugars in the oven. Not this one. Inspired by a classic Japanese appetizer, this soup zeroes in on the nutty, earthy flavors of squash by simply simmering it in an aromatic dashi broth.","Yield:Serves 4
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 1/2 quarts plus 2 cups water, divided, plus more as needed
1/2 ounce kombu (approximately a 4- by 6-inch piece; see note)
1/2 ounce grated bonito flakes (about 3 cups; see note)
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided
1 leek, white and light green parts only, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)
2 medium carrots, diced (about 1 cup)
2 medium cloves garlic, sliced
2 (1 1/2-inch) knobs ginger, 1 knob peeled and thinly sliced, 1 knob peeled and finely grated, divided

1 tablespoon fresh juice from 1 lemon
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
Pinch sugar, if needed
1 large crisp apple, such as Fuji, peeled, cored, and diced
1 large or 2 medium scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced on the bias
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
Shichimi togarashi, optional (see note)","1.
Combine 1 1/2 quarts water, kombu, and bonito flakes in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool for 5 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh strainer. Discard solids and set dashi aside.
2.
In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add leek, carrot, garlic, and sliced ginger. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are glistening and just starting to turn tender, about 4 minutes.
3.
Add squash and pour just enough dashi on top to cover vegetables. Bring to a simmer and cook until vegetables are fully tender, about 30 minutes. Using a standing blender or immersion blender, and working in batches if necessary, blend soup until very smooth. Blend in miso and lemon juice.
4.
Return soup to pot and thin with enough water to reach a pourable, silky-smooth consistency. Season with salt, add sugar to taste, and keep warm.
5.
Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Add diced apple and let soak for 10 minutes. Drain apple well, then return to bowl. Toss with grated ginger, scallions, toasted sesame seeds, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Season with salt, if needed.
6.
To serve, ladle hot soup into bowls and top with the apple-scallion salad. Garnish with shichimi togarashi, if desired.

For the Filling:
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
For the Topping:
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1.
In bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix butter, cream cheese, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt on medium speed until completely combined, about 1 minute. Mix in vanilla until combined. Mix in flour until combined.
2.
Pat dough into an 8-inch square, wrap dough in plastic wrap, and chill until fairly firm, about 1 hour. In the meantime, mix together ingredients for filling in medium bowl.
3.
Adjust oven rack to upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
4.
Cut dough into 4 equal pieces. On a floured surface, and working one piece of dough at a time, roll out into a 12-inch by 4-inch strip. Sprinkle 1/4 of the chocolate mixture onto dough and gently press into dough to adhere.
5.
Working from the long end, gently roll dough strip into a 12-inch long log, making sure seam is at the bottom. Cut log into 1-inch pieces and place on one half of the baking sheet, evenly spacing apart. Repeat with second piece of dough to fill the first pan. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough to fill second pan. (You should have 24 rugelach per pan).

Alfajores Con Cajeta (Vanilla Shortbread With Goat's-Milk Toffee) Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Flecked with vanilla seeds throughout the dough, alfajores are the perfect excuse to whip up a batch of vanilla bean cajeta—a goat's-milk variation on dulce de leche. The combination of gooey toffee sauce and buttery shortbread can't be beat, but it can be improved upon. My recipe replaces traditional cornstarch with tapioca starch, keeping the alfajores tender and light, with a clean finish that truly melts away. Pair them with a mug of strong black coffee, or a nip of Rainwater Madeira.","Yield:Makes 25 (2-inch) sandwich cookies
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 vanilla bean, preferably Mexican
4 ounces all-purpose flour (3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 115g)
3 ounces tapioca starch (3/4 cup; 85g)
2 ounces powdered sugar (1/2 cup; 55g), plus more for dusting
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon (1g) baking powder
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 115g), cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 large egg yolks, cold
1 recipe Cajeta Casera (see note)","1.
Split vanilla bean lengthwise with a paring knife and scrape out seeds with the flat of the blade; reserve empty pod for cajeta or another use. Combine vanilla seeds with flour, tapioca starch, powdered sugar, salt, baking powder, and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to form a fine and sandy meal, then add egg yolks and continue processing until the dough balls up around the blade. Divide in half and proceed to step 2, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week.
2.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Turn a portion of dough onto a powdered sugar–dusted surface and dust more powdered sugar on top. Roll dough until roughly 6 inches across, then dust with powdered sugar, flip upside down, and dust again. Continue rolling until dough is just shy of 1/4 inch thick. Slide a thin offset spatula under dough to loosen any places that might have stuck and cut dough into 2-inch rounds. Arrange cutouts on a parchment-lined aluminum half-sheet pan, leaving about 1/2 inch between cookies. Gather the scraps, briefly knead, and re-roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough, for a total of 50 pieces. Bake until just beginning to brown around the edges, about 15 minutes, and cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan.
3.
Transfer cajeta to a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/4-inch tip. Flip half the cookies bottom side up and pipe a generous dollop of cajeta into the very center, up to 1/2 ounce (4 teaspoons; 14g), or less if you prefer. Alternatively, this can be done with a spoon. Top with remaining wafers and press gently to secure. Dust with powdered sugar and serve. In an airtight container, alfajores will keep 24 hours at room temperature or up to 1 week in the fridge.

Buttery Marzipan Stollen Recipe,,"Stollen really isn't that difficult to bake at home. [Photographs: Yvonne Ruperti]
Stollen is one of the world's great Christmas breads, a delicious treat whether you celebrate Christmas or not. Most people buy it, but the truth is that stollen is as easy to make at home as any basic bread.
Why This Recipe Works:
Soaking the yeast in advance with flour and milk (known as a sponge) adds flavor.
Chopped orange zest takes the place of candied citron peel.
The layer of marzipan keeps the stollen moist.
A butter and sugar glaze locks in additional moisture.
Note: For the orange peel, use a sharp vegetable peeler to slice off the outer peel of the orange (it's okay if a small amount of the white pith is included), then finely chop. This is a dense bread, so you may not notice much rising of the dough, but it will rise more when baked.","Yield:makes 1 (1 3/4-pound) stollen
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:4 to 5 hours
Rated: 4","Ingredients
1/3 cup (3 ounces) milk
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon bread flour, divided, plus more if needed
1 tablespoon bourbon
1/2 cup (3 ounces) raisins
1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 large egg yolk
3/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, softened, divided
4 teaspoons finely chopped orange peel from one orange (see note)
1/3 cup (3 ounces) sliced almonds
3 1/2 ounces marzipan
For the Glaze:
4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter, melted
1 cup (4 ounces) confectioner's sugar","1.
Heat milk in small saucepan over low heat until just warm. Pour into bowl of stand mixer and whisk in yeast and 1 tablespoon bread flour. Set aside for 30 minutes. In same unwashed saucepan, gently heat bourbon and raisins until warm; set aside.
2.
Add 1 1/4 cups bread flour, sugar, and egg yolk to yeast mixture. Mix with dough hook at low speed just until mixture begins to come together, about 1 minute. With mixer running, add salt and then slowly add butter to incorporate. If dough seems too wet, add up to a few tablespoons more flour. Continue to mix until a soft, smooth dough forms, about 8 minutes. Mix in raisins, orange zest, and almonds until just incorporated.
3.
Form dough into a ball, place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rest in a warm place until dough has risen by about 50 percent, 1 to 2 hours.
4.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350&degF. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place dough onto lightly floured work surface and press into an 8- by 10-inch oval. Using rolling pin, press a trench lengthwise into the dough about 1/3 from the bottom.
5.
Roll the marzipan into a log to fit the length of the stollen. Place the log on worksurface and flatten with a rolling pin to about 1/2 inch thick. Place the strip of marzipan into the trench in the dough.
6.
Lift the bottom portion of dough up and over the marzipan to seal it inside, being sure not to fold it so far as to make the edges meet (this will form the hump on top of the stollen). Gently press top of stollen with rolling pin to seal, leaving the hump of dough on the top. Carefully transfer the stollen to the parchment-lined baking sheet, loosely cover, and let rest in a warm place for about 45 minutes.
7.
Bake until golden brown and just cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Do not overbake or your stollen will be dry.
8.
For the Glaze: Brush stollen immediately with half the melted butter. Sprinkle with a coating of confectioner's sugar. Brush with remaining melted butter and sift 1/2 of the remaining confectioners' sugar over the top. Let cool. Sift with remaining confectioners' sugar and serve.

Rolled Sugar Cookie Cutouts Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik. Video: Natalie Holt]
These tender sugar cookies owe their richness and shelf life to a blend of butter and coconut oil, which also helps amplify the vanilla taste. I'm fond of blending vanilla beans and extract with a few drops of almond extract for the most depth of flavor, but it's fine to simplify those ingredients based on what you have on hand. Whether you bake them crisp and golden or keep them soft and pale, these sugar cookies are perfect for care packages and holiday gifts alike.","Yield:Makes 36 (3-inch) cookies or 70 (1 1/2–inch) cookies (see note)

3 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil (about 1/2 cup; 100g), firm but creamy, about 70°F (21°C)
8 ounces sugar (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 225g)
1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped, pod reserved for another use (optional)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (about 1/34 ounces; 50g)
12 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups; 355g), plus more for dusting
Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)","1.
Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, vanilla seeds (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and almond extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Pause to scrape the bowl with a flexible spatula, then beat a minute more. In chilly winter months, this process may take longer (see our guide to winter baking for more info).
2.
With the mixer running, crack in the egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix until dough begins to gather around the paddle but the flour hasn't quite disappeared. Fold once or twice with a flexible spatula to ensure the dough is well combined. Divide in half and proceed to the next step, or wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week. Refrigerated dough should be left to stand at room temperature until soft and pliable, then lightly kneaded to restore its plasticity before rolling.
3.
When ready to bake, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). On a generously floured surface, roll a portion of the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch; check with a ruler to make sure your dough isn't too thin, or else the finished cookies will be more inclined to break. Slide an offset spatula underneath the dough to loosen. Cut with assorted cookie cutters and transfer to a parchment-lined half-sheet pan, leaving at least an inch of space in between cookies. Knead scraps together, then roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough.
4.
Transfer to oven to bake. For soft cookies, bake until puffed and firm but perfectly pale, about 12 minutes. For crisp cookies, continue baking until pale gold around the very edges, about 3 minutes more. Let the cookies cool to room temperature directly on the sheet pan, about 30 minutes. The true flavor and texture of the cookies will take another 30 minutes to develop. If you like, finish with a dusting of powdered sugar, or decorate with my favorite not-too-sweet Royal Icing (full decorating tutorial here). Store in an airtight container up to 1 week at room temperature.

Classic Chocolate Yule Log Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Our classic Yule log starts with a no-fuss chocolate roulade, made with unsweetened chocolate and butter (or a flavorful oil, like roasted hazelnut or pistachio oil). Because the cake itself depends entirely on the quality of the chocolate involved, make sure to use the best you can find, even if that means opting for a chocolate in the 80% range rather than one that's entirely unsweetened. See our roundup of the best extra-dark chocolates for reliable supermarket options or order online from brands like Dandelion, Tcho, Pralus, or Raaka.","Yield:Makes one 16-inch roll cake, serving 12 to 16 depending on how it is cut
Active time: About 30 minutes
Total time:About 2 1/2 hours
Rated: 4.8","Ingredients
For the Cake:
2 1/2 ounces pistachio oil, roasted hazelnut oil, or melted butter (about 1/3 cup; 70g)
2 1/2 ounces finely chopped dark chocolate, between 85% and 100% (slightly rounded 1/3 cup;70g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
5 large eggs (8 3/4 ounces; 250g)
5 3/4 ounces sugar (about 3/4 cup; 165g)
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 ounces water (about 2 1/2 tablespoons; 35g)
3 3/4 ounces bread flour (about 3/4 cup, spooned; 106g)
For the Ganache Frosting:
12 ounces finely chopped dark chocolate, between 55% and 75%, or a blend thereof (about 2 heaping cups; 340g)
12 ounces heavy cream (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)
Salt and vanilla to taste
For the Filling:
2 cups sweetened whipped cream, buttercream, or other frosting, see note (weight will vary)
To Garnish:
Matcha powder, optional
Cocoa powder, optional
1 recipe meringue mushrooms, optional","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line an aluminum half-sheet pan with parchment along the bottom, and grease with pan spray or oil.
2.
For the Cake: In a 1-quart stainless steel saucier, melt the butter (or heat the oil) over medium-low until quite hot, about 200°F. Off heat, add the chopped chocolate and vanilla, and whisk until smooth. Set aside until needed, no longer than the duration of the steps below, as the mixture will thicken as it cools and become unsuitable for incorporating into the batter. The ganache should be fluid and warm for use, around 100°F (this number is provided for context; so long as the ganache is in a pourable state its temperature does not need to be measured).
3.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the eggs, sugar, instant espresso, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Mix on medium-low speed until the sugar has dissolved and the dark brown mixture is homogenous, smooth, and runny, but with bubbles beginning to form throughout, about 3 minutes.
4.
Increase speed to medium and whip until the mixture has lightened to a dark tan, with a lighter/more voluminous body than before. It will still be runny but thick enough to fall from the whisk in thin ribbons, about 5 minutes. Finally, increase speed to high, and continue whipping until the mixture is foamy and thick, light brown in color, and roughly doubled in volume, with a well-defined vortex pattern left in the eggs as it whips, about 8 minutes. When allowed to run off the whisk and into the bowl, the mixture should be able to briefly mound up on itself before leveling off. Please bear in mind all times are ballpark figures only and may vary considerably depending on the power and capacity of a given stand mixer, along with factors such as bowl-to-beater clearance (more on that here). In all cases, the visual and textural cues should be the primary guideline to determine readiness.
5.
Once the foamed eggs are fluffy and thick, reduce speed to medium-high and immediately add water, followed by the warm chocolate mixture, then reduce speed to medium-low and add the sifted flour. When the flour is nearly incorporated, shut off the mixer and remove the whisk attachment. Grasping the attachment by its top, give the batter a few strokes of the whisk by hand to finish incorporating the flour. Fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then scrape into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Bake until well risen and firm to the touch, but still puffy and soft enough to retain a shallow impression when gently poked, about 12 minutes. Over-baking will cause the cake to crack as it rolls.
6.
Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, cover the half-sheet pan with two large strips of foil, using a kitchen towel or oven mitt to tightly crimp the foil around the edges of the pan. Allow the cake to cool until approximately 70°F/21°C (this temperature is provided for context and can be gauged by touch rather than with a thermometer; warm cake will melt the filling, and cold cake will crack as it rolls).
7.
For the Ganache: While the cake is cooling, bring the cream to a simmer in a 2-quart stainless steel saucier; once it begins to bubble, remove from heat. Whisk in the chocolate, and season to taste with additional salt and vanilla or as desired with other extracts and flavorings. Set aside until the ganache has thickened and cooled into a frosting-like consistency, about 2 hours, or to a temperature around 75°F.
8.
Assembling the Yule Log: Loosen the edges of the cooled cake from the pan with a butter knife. Spread about 2 cups of freshly whipped cream (flavored or plain), buttercream, frosting, or jam in an even layer over the cake. Working along the widest end, lift the edge of the cake by the parchment underneath and gently fold it inward until it turns over itself. Continue rolling, using the parchment to lift and maneuver the cake; it will naturally peel away as you go.
9.
If you like, slice off a 4-inch chunk of cake at a sharp angle, to serve as a branch for the log. Place cake on a large platter, and to nestle the ""branch,"" place it against the main body of the roulade. This can also be done vertically, anchored with a few drinking straws inserted through the ""branch"" and into the body of the ""log."" However the pieces are arranged, frost the roulade with a thick layer of ganache.
10.
When the ganache has begun to thicken and set to a firmer consistency, drag the tines of a fork down the length of the cake and along the ""branches"" to create a rough texture, like tree bark. Repeat as needed to further texturize the exterior. Garnish with a sprinkling of matcha for moss, a dusting of cocoa for dirt, and meringue mushrooms to complete the effect. Serve immediately, or wrap tightly in plastic until needed. Cakes filled with whipped cream can be refrigerated up to 36 hours and taste best when allowed to stand at room temperature a few hours before serving. Cakes filled with buttercream or frosting can be stored at cool room temperature for up to 36 hours.

Ever since I made this Filipino lechon liempo with pork belly, I've been looking for any excuse to get another hunk of fatty belly onto the spit. While I could have formulated a good excuse any day, I finally realized I was holding out for this, a holiday porchetta!
This porchetta gets a double dose of pork: a brined pork loin on top of pork belly that's been scored and rubbed with an aromatic mixture of spices, herbs, garlic, and lemon zest. The whole affair was rolled, tied tightly, and slowly cooked on the rotisserie until the skin blistered and crackled.
You probably don't need me to tell you how delicious this was. How can you go wrong with pork wrapped in fatty pork with crunchy skin? The impressiveness of this monster roast makes it perfect for the holiday table, but it's so good that'll you'll want to eat it all year.","Yield:serves 10
Active time: 1 1/2 hour
Total time:6 hours
Rated: 4.5","Ingredients
For the Brine
2 quarts cold water
1/3 cup salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1 whole pork loin, trimmed of silverskin and excess fat (about 3 pounds)
For the Rub
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
1 tablespoon fennel seed
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon freshly minced garlic (about 3 medium cloves)
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 whole boneless pork belly (5 to 6 pounds)
Type of fire: three-zone split
Grill heat: medium","1.
To make the brine: In a large bowl, whisk together water, salt, and sugar until solids are dissolved. Submerge pork loin in brine. Place in refrigerator and brine for 2 hours.
2.
To make the rub: Place peppercorns and fennel seed in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat; toast spices until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder and process until coarsely ground. Transfer spice mixture to small bowl and mix in sage, rosemary, garlic, thyme, crushed red pepper, and lemon zest. Set aside.
3.
Lay pork belly, skin side down, on a large cutting board. Score flesh with a sharp knife at an angle about every inch. Repeat in opposite direction to create a diamond pattern. Season pork belly liberally with salt. Sprinkle rub evenly across pork belly, using hands to pat rub into meat and cut crevices.
4.
Remove pork loin from brine; pat dry with paper towels. Place in center of pork belly. Roll pork belly around pork loin so it fully encases loin. Tie roll close with butcher twine about every inch.
5.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on either side of the charcoal grate and place a foil pan between the two piles of coals. Cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Run spit of the rotisserie through middle of pork roll and secure ends with rotisserie forks. Place on the rotisserie, cover, and cook at medium heat until skin has darkened and crisped and pork registers 155ºF when an instant read thermometer is inserted into the thickest part of the meat, about 3 hours, replenishing coals to maintain temperature as needed. Remove from grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove spit, slice, and serve.

Crispy Lemon-Ginger Sandwich Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
With plenty of lemon zest in the dough and fresh-squeezed juice in the filling, these crunchy ginger cookies taste zippy and bright—a refreshing change of pace from the darker profile of gingersnaps or classic gingerbread cookies. Enjoy with tea, or serve alongside a scoop of your favorite ice cream.","Yield:Makes about 32 (1 1/2–inch) cookies
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 1/2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Dough:
5 1/4 ounces sugar (about 3/4 cup; 150g)
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 110g)
1 ounce unsulfured molasses (about 1 heaping tablespoon; 30g), not blackstrap
1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon Ceylon cinnamon or 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground or grated nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/8 ounce lemon zest (1 tablespoon; 4g)
6 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 1/3 cups, spooned; 170g)
1 ounce heavy cream (2 tablespoons; 30g)
For the Filling:
5 ounces powdered sugar (about 1 1/4 cups; 145g)
2 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil (about 1/3 cup; 70g); see note
1/2 ounce fresh juice from 1 lemon (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 teaspoon pure lemon extract or lemon oil
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, butter, molasses, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon zest. Mix on low until moistened, then increase to medium and cream until soft and light, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add flour all at once, then drizzle in cream and mix until fully incorporated.
2.
With a 1 1/2–teaspoon scoop, divide dough into about 40 level portions. Cut each in half, then roll smooth and round between your palms. Alternatively, scale out 3/8-ounce (10g) portions, then roll smooth. (They will look tiny, but they'll spread considerably as they bake!) Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 1 1/4 inches between them to account for spreading. Bake until cookies are golden brown, no longer puffy, and a little firm around the edges, about 10 minutes. If needed, rotate pan about halfway through to ensure even baking. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the cookies will not be crisp while warm.
3.
For the Filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine powdered sugar, coconut oil, lemon juice, lemon extract, and salt. Mix on low to combine, then increase to medium and cream until soft and light, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch pastry tip and use immediately.
4.
To Assemble: Flip half the cookies upside down and pipe a shy 1/4 ounce filling (about a heaping teaspoon or 6g, but there's no need to measure) into the center of each. Sandwich with remaining cookies. Due to the slightly irregular shape of drop cookies, you'll need to play a bit of mix-and-match to ensure similarly shaped cookies are paired together.
5.
Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate 15 minutes to harden the coconut oil. If temperatures in your kitchen routinely climb above 75°F (24°C), it will be best to store the cookies in the fridge and bring a few to room temperature as needed to serve. Stored this way, the cookies will last about 1 month. If your kitchen is generally cooler than 75°F, after chilling you may store the cookies at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Brussels sprouts have come a long way in the days since they were boiled to a stinky, cabbage-y death. Rapid, high-heat cooking has been the game-changer for me, but what if I told you that there's an even better way to cook Brussels sprouts? One that forgoes that quick cooking in lieu of extra-richness and flavor? A method that not only delivers decadently delicious results, but can be made 100% ahead of time with just a short stay in the oven prior to serving? This cheesy casserole packed with bacon and Brussels sprouts is where it's at.
Why this recipe works:
Browning our bacon with butter adds plenty of sweet, smoky flavor to our finished casserole.
Bacon combined with reduced heavy cream and cheese creates an incredibly decadent and rich background for the sprouts.

This rich Mediterranean spread, known as brandade in France, baccalà mantecato in Italy, and brandada in Spain, is made by whipping salt cod with olive oil and half-and-half until smooth and creamy. Fold in mashed potatoes for a milder version, or use pure fish for a more toothsome texture.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10 as an hors d'oeuvre
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour 15 minutes, plus 24 hours soaking
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 pound salt cod
1/2 pound whole russet potatoes (about 2 medium potatoes; see note)
5 medium whole cloves garlic, plus 2 optional minced medium cloves garlic, divided (see note)
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil (or 3/4 cup if no potato)
1/2 cup half-and-half (or 1/4 cup if no potato)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems (optional)
Zest of 1/2 lemon (optional)
Crackers or baguette toasts, for serving","1.
Rinse salt cod under cold running water until any salt on its surface is washed away. Transfer to a large container (cut the salt cod into smaller pieces if it doesn't fit whole) and cover with fresh water. Refrigerate for 24 hours, changing the water several times during that period.
2.
Bake potatoes in a 350°F oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Alternatively, put potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold unsalted water; set over medium-high heat, bring to a simmer, and cook until easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Split potatoes lengthwise, scoop flesh from potato skins, and mash using a food mill, ricer, or potato masher. Set aside.
3.
Meanwhile, drain salt cod and place in a medium saucepan. Cover with cold unsalted water and add 5 whole cloves garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and let stand in cooking liquid for 20 minutes.
4.
Drain salt cod, reserving garlic; discard thyme and bay leaf. Flake salt cod, discarding any bones and silvery membranes.
5.
Transfer salt cod and reserved cooked garlic to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle; add remaining 2 minced garlic cloves for a more intense garlic flavor. With the mixer running at medium-high speed, drizzle in the olive oil until fully incorporated. Then drizzle in half-and-half until fully incorporated.
6.
Add mashed potatoes and whip just long enough to fully incorporate. Season with salt and pepper, and mix in optional flavorings, like minced parsley or lemon zest, if using.
7.
Serve the brandade at room temperature with crackers or baguette toasts, or serve it warm and browned on top by transferring to an oven-safe baking dish or gratin dish and baking at 350°F for 10 minutes; then broil until browned on top, about 3 minutes.

Truly Candied Yams (Sweet Potatoes) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Candied yams are a classic of the Southern table, but most recipes suffer from a fatal flaw: a sauce that breaks into sugar and grease in the oven. With a couple simple but critical adjustments, we can fix that, for yams that are silky, tender, and glazed in a syrupy lacquer.","Yield:Serves 6 to 10 as a side dish
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:2 hours 10 minutes
Rated: 4","Ingredients
2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg) sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds

1/4 cup unsalted butter (2 ounces; 60g)
1/2 cup (120ml) water
1 tablespoon (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1 tablespoon (15ml) apple cider vinegar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger","1.
In a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, arrange sweet potato rounds in an even layer, overlapping where necessary to fit them all. Set aside.
2.
In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter, water, and salt and bring to a boil, stirring often, until syrup registers 220°F (104°C) on an instant-read thermometer.

3.
Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and place in a cold oven. Turn on oven to 250°F (120°C) and allow it to come up to temperature. Cook, stopping to flip and baste potatoes with syrup every 20 minutes, until tender throughout, about 1 hour 15 minutes. (Exact cooking time will depend on your oven, baking dish, and the size of your potatoes, so check frequently.)
4.
Remove foil and continue to cook, flipping and basting potatoes occasionally, until they are very soft and glazed in a rich brown syrup, about 30 minutes longer. Let cool slightly, then serve.

Warmed pita and/or bread, for serving","1.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Set cubed potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water until water runs clear. Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 2 inches. Season water with salt until it is salty like tears. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds.
2.
Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine almonds, garlic, 2 tablespoons (30ml) cold water, and wine vinegar and/or lemon juice. Process until garlic and almonds are reduced to a paste. Season with salt.

Season with salt, then garnish with parsley and serve immediately with warm pita or bread, or chill until ready to serve.

Apple-Pecan Bourbon-Caramel Pie Recipe,,"Apple pie and pecan pie, two classics, unite to form a pie that may be greater than either of the originals. [Photographs: Jennifer Latham]
Apple pie and pecan pie: two world-famous classics. But let's be honest, one's a little wholesome and the other's a little too sweet. You know which is which. But what if we combine them into a single pie with an apple filling and pecan bourbon-caramel top ""crust""? And what if we told you it's easier to make and assemble than either of the originals? This may be the greatest pie mashup ever.
Why this recipe works:
Making each component separately and then assembling the finished pie simplifies the process while guaranteeing a crisp bottom crust.
Partially peeling the apples gets more pectin into the filling, helping to make it less liquid-y, while ensuring that the filling isn't filled with annoyingly large pieces of apple skin.","Yield:Makes one 9-inch pie (8 large or 12 small slices)
Active time: 50 minutes
Total time:1 hour","Ingredients
For the Crust:
All-purpose flour, for dusting
1 recipe Easy Pie Dough
1 large egg yolk
1 tablespoon cream
Demerara sugar, for sprinkling
For the Apple Filling:
3 1/2 pounds tart baking apples, such as Braeburn, Golden Delicious, Jonathan, or Jonagold
4 ounces fresh juice from 2 lemons
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Pinch of allspice
Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
For the Pecan Bourbon-Caramel:
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup light corn syrup
2 tablespoons maple syrup or sorghum syrup
2 tablespoons bourbon whiskey
1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 1/2 cups whole pecans, toasted","1.
For the Crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll pie crust out on a lightly-floured work surface to a circle roughly 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a plate, rolling up overhanging edge and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Whisk egg with cream. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate, then, using kitchen shears or a paring knife, trim crust around edge of pie plate. Crimp crust edge, then brush crimped edge with egg wash and sprinkle with demerara sugar (do not brush or sugar bottom of crust or wax paper will stick to it). Line bottom of crust with a round of wax paper, add dried beans or pie weights, and bake crust until edge is golden, about 15 minutes. Remove weights and wax paper and bake crust until bottom and side is golden, about 5 minutes longer. Let cool slightly.
2.
Meanwhile, for the Apple Filling: Peel apples partially in a spiral pattern, starting at the stem and proceeding towards the bottom, removing about half the skin while leaving a stripe of skin on each apple. Core apples and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Toss apple slices with lemon juice in a large mixing bowl.
3.
In a small bowl, mix butter with flour to form a smooth paste.
4.
Add butter-flour mixture, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, allspice, and nutmeg to apples and stir to combine. Scrape apple mixture into a large, wide-bottomed pot and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Allow apples to cool slightly, then scrape into pre-baked pie crust.
5.
For the Pecan Bourbon-Caramel: While apples are cooling, place granulated sugar, butter, heavy cream, corn syrup, maple syrup, bourbon, molasses, and salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until ingredients are fully combined, about 2 minutes. Stop stirring, turn heat to medium high, and cook until mixture reaches 236°F on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes. Off the heat, allow caramel to cool to 190 degrees, about 3 minutes. Mix in toasted pecans, then spoon the caramel-pecan mixture over the apples, patting and shaping to form an even coating. (If you don't want to use all the caramel pecan mixture on top of the pie, any leftovers can be spooned onto a lined baking sheet and cooled to make turtles.) Let pie cool to room temperature, then slice and serve.

Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling and greasing
1 large butternut squash (about 3 1/2 pounds; 1.6kg)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick; 57g), plus more if needed
20 sage leaves (from about 3 sprigs)
1 large onion (about 8 ounces; 225g), thinly sliced
4 medium cloves garlic, minced
1 package cream cheese (8 ounces; 225g), at room temperature
1/2 cup sour cream (4 ounces; 113g)
8 ounces cheddar cheese (about 2 cups; 230g), shredded
Crackers or pita chips, to dip","1.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Grease a small baking dish with olive oil and set aside.
2.
Peel, seed, and dice the squash into 1-inch cubes, using this guide.
Alternatively, use the microwave: Poke holes all over the squash with a fork or make shallow slits in the skin with a knife. Microwave squash for 3 minutes or until the skin and flesh have softened slightly. Peel squash and cut into cubes. Discard seeds.
3.
Place squash cubes on the prepared sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper.
4.
Roast squash until fork-tender and lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
5.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add sage leaves and fry in butter until lightly crisped and beginning to darken slightly. Remove pan from heat and remove sage leaves using a slotted spoon. Set aside.
6.
Return pan to heat, add onion, and season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion has caramelized, about 30 minutes. Add more butter if onion begins to stick to pan. Stir in garlic at the very end and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
7.
Place roasted squash, caramelized onion mixture, and about 2/3 of the crispy sage leaves into the bowl of a food processor. Process until well combined. Add cream cheese and sour cream and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.
8.
Transfer squash mixture to prepared baking dish and mix in half of the cheddar cheese throughout. Top with remaining half of cheese. At this point, the dip can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days before baking and serving.
9.
When ready to serve, bake dip at 400°F until cheese is entirely melted and browned in spots, about 20 minutes. Top with remaining crispy sage leaves and serve warm with pita chips or crackers for dipping.

1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons fresh juice from 1 lemon
2 tablespoons flour
2 cups whole milk
12 ounces whole milk mozzarella, grated, divided
2 ounces Parmiggiano-reggiano, grated","1.
Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach in batches, allowing previous batch to wilt before adding next. Once all spinach is added, add 1 cup heavy cream. Bring to a boil, and reduce to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until thick and reduced, about 15 minutes. Add nutmeg, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
2.
While spinach is cooking, combine cottage cheese, egg, and 6 tablespoons parsley in the bowl of a food processor. Process until combined and cottage cheese is broken up to the texture of ricotta cheese, about 5 seconds.
3.
Combine cooked spinach and cottage cheese mixture in a large bowl. Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles in a 8- by 13-inch baking dish and cover with warm water. Allow to soak, agitating occasionally to prevent sticking, until lightly softened, about 15 minutes. Transfer in a single layer to a clean kitchen towel to dry.
4.
While noodles soak, wipe out spinach pot and return to medium-high heat. Add 3 more tablepsoons butter and heat until melted. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates and mushrooms start to sizzle, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce and lemon juice and stir to combine. Add remaining heavy cream. Bring to a simmer, and cook until lightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to another bowl.
5.
Wipe out pot and return to medium-high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and heat until melted. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, until light golden blond. Slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. Stir in 2/3rds of mozzarella and parmesan, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
6.
To assemble lasagna, dry the 8- by 13-inch baking dish and grease with butter. Add 1 cup cheese sauce to bottom of dish. Lay three noodles on top of it, spacing them evenly across the bottom of the dish (there will be about 1/4-inch gap between each noodle and the edge of the pan. This is fine). Top noodles evenly with half of mushroom mixture, then top with another three noodles. Top with half of spinach/cottage cheese mixture, then top with another three noodles. Repeat layers with remaining mushroom mixture, spinach mixture, and noodles, ending with a layer of noodles. Pour remaining cheese sauce over top and spread evenly. Sprinkle remaining 1/3rd of grated mozzarella evenly over top.
7.
Bake until lasagna is bubbling around the edges, about 20 minutes. Switch broiler on and broil until top is lightly browned, about 5 minutes longer (if you have an under-oven broiler, you'll have to transfer it to the broiler after baking). Let cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.

"Gravlax With Caraway, Coriander, and Mustard-Dill Sauce Recipe",,"Gravlax might be the easiest and most inexpensive of luxury foods. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Luxurious foods are, practically by definition, extremely expensive. Except for gravlax. For the price of a fresh piece of salmon, you can cure your own gravlax at home, then slice it and serve it as one of the most elegant hors d'oeuvres or light appetizers imaginable. In this recipe, we cure the salmon with sugar and salt, caraway, coriander, and dill, then serve it with a tangy mustard-dill sauce.","Yield:Serves 10 to 15 as an hors d'oeuvre
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:2 to 3 days
Rated: 3.3333333333333","Ingredients
Kosher salt
1 (2-pound; 900g) skin-on sushi-grade salmon fillet, pin bones removed by fishmonger
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
40g kosher salt (about 4 tablespoons), plus more for washing salmon
25g sugar (about 1 tablespoon)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper or black pepper
2 large bunches dill
For the Sauce:
3 tablespoons (45ml) distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons roughly chopped dill fronds
5 tablespoons (75ml) Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon (15g) sugar
1/4 cup (60ml) canola or vegetable oil
Freshly ground black pepper
Sliced pumpernickel bread, for serving","1.
Fill a large bowl with cold water and add enough salt to make it taste like the sea. Add salmon and let stand 10 minutes.
2.
In a skillet, toast caraway and coriander seeds over high heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind finely.
3.
In a small bowl, stir together salt, sugar, ground caraway and coriander seeds, and white or black pepper until thoroughly combined.
4.
Remove salmon from bath and pat dry with paper towels. On a work surface, turn salmon skin side up and sprinkle about half of salt mixture all over, rubbing in with fingers.
5.
Arrange half of dill all over the bottom of a baking dish large enough to hold salmon. Set salmon skin side down on bed of dill. Rub remaining salt mixture all over top and sides of salmon, then top with remaining dill. Cover salmon with plastic, then top with a weight (such as a smaller baking dish or plate with cans of beans on top). Refrigerate for 1 day.
6.
After 1 day, unpack salmon and turn skin side up. Re-pack with dill, cover with plastic, and set weight back on top. Refrigerate until salmon is sufficiently cured, 1 day longer for a lighter cure or 2 days longer for slightly more cure (which will mean a slightly firmer texture and saltier flavor).
7.
For the Sauce: Before serving, make the sauce. In a blender or mini food processor, or using an immersion blender, combine vinegar with chopped dill fronds, mustard, and sugar and blend until dill is very finely chopped. Add oil and blend until a smooth sauce has formed. Season with salt and pepper.
8.
Unpack salmon, scraping off dill, and set on a work surface. Using a very sharp slicing knife, cut gravlax on a bias into thin slices. Arrange on slices of pumpernickel bread and drizzle sauce on top. Serve. Gravlax can be kept refrigerated, tightly wrapped in plastic, for approximately 5 days after curing.

As demonstrated recently with prime rib, savory and funky shio koji is great at bringing out the meaty best in ingredients.
For this spin on French duck confit, we use shio koji in place of the traditional salt and spice cure, slathering it on duck legs with black peppercorns and star anise. The salt and enzymes in the shio koji quickly go to work, deeply seasoning the meat in just 12 hours. The koji cure is then rinsed off, the duck legs are submerged in rendered fat, and they're cooked low and slow in the oven until tender.
This duck confit is intensely savory, with a background note of sweetness from the natural sugars from the koji kin, which also helps produce deep golden brown skin when you eventually crisp it for serving. If you've been curious about the transformative powers of shio koji, this is a great recipe to start with.","Yield:Makes 4 duck legs (serving 4; see note)
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:4 hours, plus 12 hours resting time","Ingredients
4 duck legs (about 2 1/4 pounds total; 1kg) (see note)
1 cup (300g; 240ml) homemade shio koji (see note)
2 teaspoons (6g) whole black peppercorns
3 star anise pods
2 to 4 cups (475 to 950ml) rendered duck fat (see note)","1.
The Day Before Cooking Confit: Combine duck legs, shio koji, peppercorns, and star anise in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until duck legs are evenly coated on all sides with shio koji. Lay bag flat on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not cure legs longer than 24 hours, as they will over-cure, resulting in salty and dry confit.
2.
When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 225°F (105°C). Melt duck fat, either in a 3-quart saucier over low heat, or in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Remove duck legs from cure, wiping away as much of the cure mixture as possible before rinsing legs gently under cold water to remove all seasonings; discard cure. Pat duck legs dry with paper towels, then arrange in single layer in saucier with duck fat (if using), making sure they are completely submerged in fat. Alternatively, arrange duck legs snugly in a small baking dish and cover with melted duck fat, making sure legs are fully submerged in fat.
3.
Cover saucier or baking dish with lid or aluminum foil, and transfer to oven. Cook until duck is completely tender and meat shows almost no resistance when pierced with a paring knife, and skin has begun to pull away from bottom of the drumstick, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
4.
Remove from oven and cool duck to room temperature in its cooking vessel, removing lid but keeping it submerged in fat. Once cool, cover container tightly and transfer to refrigerator, where confit can be stored for up to 1 month.

Fresh and Creamy Lime Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This pie relies on the killer combo of citrus and dairy (think Creamsicle) for a mellow, sweet, and sour dessert. The crispy whole wheat crust underscores the zippy custard with its graham-like flavor, while fluffy peaks of toasted meringue recall those of a classic lemon meringue pie. It all comes together in a pie that tastes both familiar and distinctive at the same time.","Yield:Makes one (9-inch) pie
Active time: About 45 minutes (with a prebaked crust)
Total time:5 hours (with a prebaked crust)
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1/2 recipe Whole Wheat Pie Crust, blind-baked according to recipe directions
For the Filling:
9 ounces sugar (shy 1 1/3 cups; 255g)
1 1/2 ounces cornstarch (about 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 42g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
4 large eggs (about 7 ounces; 195g)
1/4 ounce lime zest (about 2 tablespoons; 7g), from about 4 limes (see note)
8 ounces fresh lime juice (about 1 cup; 225g), from about 8 limes (see note)
16 ounces milk, any percentage will do (about 2 cups; 455g)
1/4 teaspoon rosewater (optional)
For the Topping:
Swiss Meringue, full or half batch as desired","1.
Getting Ready: In a 9-inch glass pie dish, prepare and blind-bake the whole wheat pie crust according to the directions in the recipe. This can be done up to a week in advance; crust can be held at room temperature if wrapped tightly in plastic.
2.
For the Filling: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt and mix until smooth, then whisk in eggs, lime zest, and lime juice, followed by milk. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly but gently, until hot to the touch, about 5 minutes.
3.
Increase heat to medium and continue whisking until thick, about 3 minutes longer. When custard begins to bubble, set a timer and continue whisking for exactly 2 minutes. (This is important to neutralize a starch-dissolving protein found in egg yolks.) Remove from heat and stir in rosewater, if using. Pour into prepared pie crust. For a silkier texture, first strain through a stainless steel sieve, pushing the thick custard through with a flexible spatula.
4.
For the Topping: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Prepare Swiss Meringue as directed, making a half or full batch depending on your own personal preference for meringue. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Starting at the very edge of the pie, pipe meringue kisses over surface of custard until completely covered. Alternatively, spread meringue over custard with the back of a spoon. Place on a wire rack set inside a half sheet pan (this setup minimizes heat transfer to the custard) and bake pie until meringue is well browned, about 15 minutes.
5.
To Serve: Cool pie to room temperature, then cover loosely in plastic and refrigerate until no warmer than 60°F (16°C), about 3 1/2 hours. Cut with a wet chef's knife, rinsing the blade clean with cold water between slices. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers can be refrigerated up to 1 week.

Active time: 1 hour
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the pork loin:
One (4- to 5-pound; 2- to 2 1/2-kg) pork loin, center cut with rind still intact (see note)
Kosher salt
1/4 cup (60ml) neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed
2 heads garlic, cut in half across the bulbs
8 sprigs fresh thyme
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
For the Spiced Apple Chutney:
4 tart baking apples (such as Granny Smith), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice
3/4 cup chopped yellow onion
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated (20g)
1/2 cup pomegranate juice (120ml)
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (150ml)
3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed (about 5 ounces; 140g)
1 teaspoon mustard seeds (about 2g)
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 star anise pod","1.
For the pork: Dry the skin as much as possible with a paper towel. Generously season the meat (not the skin) with kosher salt, including in between the ribs and meat. Place the roast on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to the refrigerator and let rest, uncovered, at least overnight and up to three days.
2.
When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C). If the butcher has not done it for you, score the rind with a very sharp knife, using long, parallel slits 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch apart across the width of the loin; be careful not to cut into the flesh.
3.
Flip the loin over and rub the flesh side with the remaining oil. Lift the meat from the bones. Place the garlic, thyme, and rosemary up against the meat. Using butcher's twine, tie the ribs back to the loin, with the aromatics sandwiched in between.
4.
Rub the rind with more salt, ensuring that the salt is rubbed well into the slits. Brush the rind with 2 tablespoons of oil.
5.
Place the loin, skin-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan or baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325°F (163°C) and cook until an instant-read thermometer poked into the center of the loin reaches 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare, or 140°F (60°C) for medium, about 1 hour. Skin should be puffy and crisp; if it’s not puffy enough, remove the roast from the oven, preheat the broiler, and place the roast a few inches under the broiler until the skin puffs.
6.
While the pork roasts, make the Apple Chutney: Combine the apples, onion, ginger, pomegranate juice, vinegar, brown sugar, mustard seeds, pepper flakes, star anise, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 45 minutes. Remove the star anise and allow to cool.
7.
When the roast is done, remove it from the oven and let the loin rest on a carving board for 30 minutes.
8.
Remove the ribs by cutting the remaining flap, discard the garlic and herbs. Carve the loin into slices following the scores so that each slice has a segment of crackling (approximately a 1/4-inch-wide strip). Serve the warm pork loin with apple chutney and your preferred sides. (We like Yorkshire puddings and a bitter green salad).

"Classic Shrimp Aguachile With Lime, Cucumber, and Red Onion Recipe",,"Aguachile is a chili-spiked style of Mexican ceviche. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
If you love ceviche, then Mexico's aguachile is for you. Traditionally made with raw shrimp, lime juice, chilies, cucumber, and onion, it's served immediately while still totally raw, unlike most other ceviche recipes. This recipe is about as close to the Sinaloa classic as you can get, and it's unbelievably delicious given its simplicity.
Note: Look for shrimp that are fresh and have never been frozen, and tell the fishmonger you are planning to eat them raw. If you can't find shrimp that are fresh enough, you can substitute gently cooked shrimp (in which case omit the salt-curing step), or another type of seafood such as raw sea scallops or sashimi-grade fish. If you buy head-on shrimp, use the heads for another purpose, such as making seafood broth, or deep-fried as a snack.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6 as a snack or appetizer

Fluffy and Nutty Almond Layer Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This recipe uses a blend of almond and all-purpose flour to strike a balance between a fluffy American cake and a hearty European torte, for a dessert that's tender, moist, and light, but also substantial. Reach for the best-quality almond extract, made from bitter almond oil, to flavor the cake, and add a splash of rose water to bring out its floral notes. The subtle sweetness and caramel notes of toasted sugar add complexity and enhance the nuttiness of almond, but plain white sugar will work in a pinch.
The almond intensity of this cake can easily be customized by adjusting the amount of almond extract to taste, so feel free to use more or less as you desire.","Yield:Makes one 8-inch, three-layer cake
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 4.8461538461538","Ingredients
For the Cake:
11 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups, spooned; 320g)
6 ounces almond flour, see note (about 1 3/4 cup; 170g)
15 ounces plain or lightly toasted sugar (about 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon; 425g)
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons (8g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
8 ounces unsalted butter (16 tablespoons; 225g), soft but cool, about 60°F (16°C)

1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 ounce pure almond extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g), more or less to taste
1/4 ounce rose water, optional (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
15 ounces whole milk (about 2 cups minus 2 tablespoons; 425g), brought to about 65°F (18°C)
To Finish:
1 recipe Chocolate Swiss Buttercream or a double batch of American-Style Chocolate Buttercream","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). If you don’t have three pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter will keep at room temperature until needed. Sift the all-purpose flour and almond flour together in a bowl, then whisk thoroughly to combine, at least 1 minute. Under-mixing the flours can produce a cake with a splotchy crust and uneven crumb.
2.
For the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, increase speed to medium. Beat until fluffy, pale, and light, about 8 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
3.
With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, followed by the vanilla extract, almond extract, and rose water (if using). Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the prepared almond-flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before.
4.
Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68°F (18 and 20°C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)
5.
Fold batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 20 ounces/565g per pan). Stagger pans together on the oven rack, and bake until puffed, firm, and beginning to brown around the edges, but relatively pale over all, about 35 minutes. If your oven has very uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake two layers at once and finish the third when they’re done.
6.
Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right-side-up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare your frosting of choice.
7.
For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here) and set the scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial here). Refrigerate cake until the buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes.
8.
To Finish: Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired. If you like, garnish with toasted, sliced or slivered almonds. To serve, bring cake to an internal temperature no cooler than 70°F (21°C) and cut into portions with a chef’s knife, wiping or rinsing the blade clean between each slice. Cover the exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the remaining cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at cool room temperature.

Rich and Creamy Saffron Arancini With Mozzarella Recipe,,"With a thin, super-crisp crust and a molten interior, this is what arancini are meant to be. [Photographs: Daniel Gritzer]
Scarred by childhood memories of dry, tasteless rice balls, I set out to create arancini the way we all want them to be: crisp on the outside with a shattering crust that breaks open to reveal tender grains of rice suspended in a rich and flavorful creamy sauce. At at the center: stretchy melted mozzarella cheese.
Why this recipe works:
Short-grain Asian rice (such as sushi rice) produces rice balls with tender rice grains that hold their shape, retain a pleasantly chewy texture, and don't become mushy, even after deep-frying.
This recipe provides instruction using either a pressure cooker (for fastest cooking time) or on the stovetop.
A bechamel sauce made with both chicken-stock and milk guarantees rice balls that are molten, not dry, inside.
A quick dip in a flour-and-water slurry before rolling in bread crumbs creates a crust that's shatteringly crisp.
Gelatin-rich chicken stock helps the rice filling set when chilled, but melts again when heated.
Note: Short-grain Asian rice, such as sushi rice, produced the best results in our tests; however, you can use risotto rice such as arborio or carnaroli and still get good results. If your homemade chicken stock remains watery even when chilled, or if you are using store-bought chicken broth, be sure to add the unflavored gelatin for best results; if your homemade stock is gelatin-rich and solidifies when chilled, you do not need to add additional gelatin.","Yield:makes 12 to 15 rice balls

2 packets (1/2 ounce) unflavored gelatin (only if using store-bought chicken broth or homemade broth that remains watery when chilled; see note)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
1/4 cup milk
2 large eggs, beaten
1 pound low-moisture mozzarella, diced
Vegetable, canola, or other neutral oil, for frying","1.
Preheat oven to 300°F. Place bread cubes on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and bake in oven until completely dried out, about 30 minutes.
2.
If using store-bought chicken broth or homemade broth that remains watery when chilled, place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. Set aside.
3.
If Making Rice in a Pressure Cooker: Heat oil in Pressure cooker over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3-4 minutes (rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center). Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine is almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 cups broth and 1 pinch saffron, scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged; season with salt. Close pressure cooker and bring up to low pressure (10 psi on most units). Cook at low pressure for 6 minutes, then depressurize cooker either by running it under cold water if it is not electric, or using the steam-release valve if it is electric. Return to heat and stir rice until it forms the texture of a thick porridge. Season with salt and pepper.

If Making Rice on Stovetop: Heat oil in large saucier pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated in oil and toasted but not browned, 3-4 minutes (rice grains should start to look like tiny ice cubes: translucent around the edges and cloudy in the center). Add wine and cook, stirring, until raw alcohol smell has cooked off and wine is almost fully evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups stock and 1 pinch saffron, scrape any grains of rice or pieces of onion from side of pressure cooker so that they are fully submerged; season with salt. When liquid has mostly evaporated, stir in 1 more cup stock and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has mostly evaporated. Stir in water 1/4 cup at a time until rice is just tender and has formed the texture of a thick porridge. Season with salt and pepper.
5.
Meanwhile, in a small saucier or saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Stir in 2 tablespoons flour to form a paste, lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring constantly, until raw-flour smell is gone but flour has not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in milk and remaining 3/4 cup stock until smooth, and add remaining 1 pinch saffron. Bring to a simmer, and continue to cook, stirring, until bechamel sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly, then whisk in eggs.
6.
Scrape rice into large mixing bowl along with bechamel sauce and stir until thoroughly incorporated. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment and scrape rice filling onto each one, spreading it in a thin, even layer. Refrigerate rice filling until thoroughly chilled and thickened, at least 1 hour.
7.
Meanwhile, if making homemade bread crumbs, transfer dried bread cubes to a food processor and process until finely ground. Transfer homemade breadcrumbs or ground panko to a plate.
8.
In a shallow bowl, whisk remaining 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 cup water to form a smooth paste, then whisk in an additional 1/4 cup water to form a slurry.
9.
Transfer chilled rice filling to a large mixing bowl and re-line rimmed sheets with fresh parchment paper. Scoop a small handful (about 1/4 cup) of rice filling in one hand (avoid wetting hands with water even though filling is sticky) and form it into a flat disk. Place a few small pieces of mozzarella in center of disk and fold rice filling around it to form a sphere with the cheese in the center. It may be difficult to form a perfect sphere at this point, but that's okay.
10.
Roll rice ball in flour slurry, then transfer to breadcrumbs and roll to coat. The rice ball may feel a little soft at this point, but you should be able to coat it in the crumbs and just manage to maintain a roughly spherical shape. Transfer to parchment and repeat with remaining rice filling, cheese, and coatings.
11.
Fill a saucepan at least 4 inches deep with vegetable oil and heat to 375°F (190°C). Pick up one breaded rice ball and re-form it into a sphere (it should now more easily take that shape). Gently set it on a slotted spoon and lower it into the oil. Repeat with remaining rice balls, working in batches and topping up oil as needed. Fry rice balls until golden brown, then, using a slotted spoon or spider, lift them one by one from the oil, allowing excess oil to drip off, then transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheets or plates. Let cool slightly, then serve. Rice balls can be allowed to cool, then stored in the refrigerator. Reheat in a 350°F (177°C) oven.

Silver Daisy (Sparkling Rum Cocktail) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The French 75 goes a little tiki in this rum-based rendition, from Jesse Cyr of Rob Roy in Seattle. Instead of the classic lemon, this version incorporates lime and a little orange curaçao.

For the Filling:
1/2 cup finely diced carrot
1/2 cup finely diced five spice tofu
1/2 cup finely diced seitan
1/4 ounce dried wood ear mushrooms, rehydrated and finely diced (about 1/4 cup)
1 cup finely diced cabbage
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon minced scallion whites

2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon white pepper powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cornstarch
24 packaged dumpling skins (keep tightly wrapped until ready to use)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
For the Dipping Sauce:
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 teaspoons light soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 scallion, sliced","1.
For the Dumplings: Combine carrots, tofu, seitan, mushroom, cabbage, garlic, scallion, sugar, sesame oil, soy sauce, white pepper, salt, and cornstarch in a large bowl and mix well. Filling can be made up to 2 hours in advance. Stir well just before using.
2.
Prepare a dumpling wrapping station with a small bowl of water, your skins, your filling with a spoon, and large parchment-lined plate or tray to hold finished dumplings. To begin wrapping the dumpling, place a little less than a tablespoon of the filling in the middle of the wrapper. Dip one finger in the water and wet half of the outer edges of the dumpling. Fold the wrapper in half and pinch the center together. Starting from the center, start pleating each side. Make 2 to 3 pleats on each side of the dumpling, pinching tightly shut. Place on plate. Repeat with remaining dumplings, making sure they don't touch on the plate.
3.
To pan-fry the dumpling, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium high heat in a large non-stick pan with a lid. When the oil is shimmering, add the dumplings, trying to avoid letting them touch each other. Pan-fry, swirling gently, until the bottom of the dumplings are golden, about 2 minutes. Holding the lid of the pan in one hand, pour ¼ cup of water into the pan. Cover the pan with the lid and steam the dumplings for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, remove the lid. Most of the water should have evaporated. If there’s a little water remaining in the pan, it’s ok. Continue pan-frying the dumplings, swirling occasionally, until the bottoms are crispy again and any remaining water is gone. When the dumplings are done, transfer onto layers of paper towel to blot off excess oil.
4.
For the Sauce: Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and scallion in a small bowl. Serve with dumplings immediately.

","A warming fall soup with the deep flavor of roasted broccoli and a gentle buttermilk tang. [Photographs: Daniel Gritzer]
On the one hand, this is a cream of broccoli soup—because it's creamy and has broccoli. Yet it has no cream, and the broccoli flavor is deeper, thanks to roasting instead of blanching. A splash of buttermilk adds brightness, while a garnish of spiced roasted pepitas plays off the roasted broccoli flavor.
Note: As you shortcut, you can substitute the spices used for the pepitas with an equal amount of store-bought curry powder. If the store-bought curry powder is salted, be sure to taste pepitas before adding salt.","Yield:makes about 10 cups

With bold spices and a delicate snap, these gingerbread cookies are the perfect holiday bite, whether served plain and simple or with a thin layer of royal icing to garnish. A pinch of orange zest in the dough helps elevate the aroma of spices, adding to their complexity of flavor. For building a gingerbread house, it's best to start with a sturdier construction-style recipe that can offer more structural integrity.","Yield:Makes about 5 dozen 2 1/2-inch rounds (yield will vary by cutter size and shape)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:About 2 hours

4 ounces unsalted butter, creamy and soft, about 68°F (about 8 tablespoons; 115g)
4 ounces light brown sugar (about 1/2 cup, gently packed; 115g)
4 ounces plain, unsulfured baking molasses, such as Golden Barrel or Grandma's, not blackstrap (about 1/3 cup; 115g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 teaspoon orange zest
3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
A few cracks of medium-grind black pepper
9 1/2 ounces low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting (about 2 cups plus two tablespoons; 270g)
Royal Icing to decorate, optional","1.
Combine butter, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla extract, orange zest, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, cloves, coriander, nutmeg, and black pepper in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy, soft, and light, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape the bowl and beater about halfway through. In chilly winter months, this process may take longer (see our guide to winter baking for more info).
2.
Reduce mixing speed to low and add the flour all at once; continue mixing until well combined. Scrape the bowl and beater well with a flexible spatula, then knead against the sides of the bowl to form a smooth ball. Divide in half and flatten into discs. If comfortable working with a soft dough, use immediately; if not, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cool and firm (timing will vary depending on personal preference). If refrigerated for longer than a few hours, let the dough stand at room temperature until softened to about 70°F before use, then knead on a bare, unfloured surface until pliable and smooth.
3.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. On a flour-dusted surface, roll a portion of dough into a 7-inch square. Sprinkle with flour, flip to sprinkle the other side, and continue roll until 1/8 inch thick, repositioning as needed to ensure the dough does not stick. After rolling, brush away the excess flour and slide an offset spatula under the dough to loosen before stamping into shapes with assorted cutters. Arrange cut-outs on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan, leaving at least 1/4 inch between each. Gather scraps, knead, re-roll, and cut as before (any scraps leftover from this second stage can be baked off to grind as cookie crumbs). Repeat with the remaining portion of dough.
4.
Bake the gingerbread until firm and dry to the touch, about 12 minutes, and cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet. If you like, decorate as desired with royal icing, and dry completely before storage (this can take 12-24 hours depending on thickness of design, ambient humidity, and air flow).
5.
With or without frosting, the gingerbread cookies will last up to 3 weeks at cool room temperature in an airtight container.

1 pound (450g) dry lasagna noodles (egg-free), cooked about 2 minutes less than package instructions indicate, then drained and chilled in ice water","1.
In a small saucepan, combine almond milk with bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic. Bring to a bare simmer, then lower heat to maintain a bare simmer for 20 minutes. Strain almond milk into a heatproof measuring cup and discard aromatics.
2.
In a small saucepan, heat coconut oil over medium heat until melted. Add flour and cook, whisking, until raw flour smell is gone, about 2 minutes.
3.
Whisking constantly, add infused almond milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pan to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.
4.
Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until béchamel sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Stir in nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.
5.
Stir 1/2 cup (120ml) vegan béchamel sauce into vegan Bolognese sauce.
6.
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Drain pasta well. In a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, lay down a single layer of lasagna sheets to cover the bottom of the dish. Spread a thin, even layer of Bolognese sauce on top, then drizzle lightly with some of the remaining béchamel sauce. Repeat in alternating layers of pasta, Bolognese sauce, and béchamel sauce until baking dish is full and/or any of the components is used up. The final layer should be Bolognese sauce with béchamel drizzled on top.
7.
Set baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until lasagna is browned on top and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Let lasagna rest 20 minutes before serving. Cut individual portions and serve while still warm.

Season with a pinch of salt and press through a fine mesh strainer. Set aside. Reserve orange syrup for another use (see note)
4.
For the Foie Gras: Lay a double layer of paper towels on top of a plate or cutting board and set aside. Season foie gras liberally on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet over high heat for at least 3 minutes. Place foie gras in skillet scored-side-down. It should immediately start smoking, sizzling, and rendering fat. If it doesn't, remove and allow the pan to preheat for another 1 to 2 minutes. Once all four pieces of foie are in skillet, cook, swirling pan gently every few seconds, until deeply browned and crisp on first side, about 30 seconds. Use a thin metal spatula to flip foie gras onto second side and cook for 30 second longer. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate and let rest for 1 minute.
5.
Spoon some orange puree onto four individual serving plates and place 1 slice of foie gras on each. Top with chives, coarse sea salt, and candied orange peel. Serve immediately with lightly dressed greens.

Oven Roasted Chestnuts with Spiced Melted Butter Recipe,"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/20121128-231780-bar-bites-slit-chestnuts.jpg
","[Photograph: Marvin Gapultos]
Served as is, or dipped in melted butter, warm roasted chestnuts are indeed creamy, nutty, and sweet. And when paired with a snifter of brandy, or even a shot of whiskey, roasted chestnuts can make for a wonderfully warming winter snack.
Choose chestnuts that are firm to the touch (there shouldn't be much give when the shell is squeezed) with smooth taut skins.","Yield:Serves 2 to 4 as a snack
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:45 minutes","Ingredients
8 cups water
1 pound fresh chestnuts, rinsed and dried
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
1 cinnamon stick
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon sugar
Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg","1.
Place a large cast iron pan in the oven and pre-heat the oven to 425°F.
2.
Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. While the water is heating, carve an ""X"" into the rounded side of each chestnut with a serrated knife. Cut through the shell only, being careful not to cut too deep into the nut itself.
3.
When the water reaches a boil, quickly blanch the slit chestnuts for 30 seconds. Drain and dry the chestnuts, then transfer them, ""X"" side up, to the heated skillet in the oven. Roast the chestnuts for 25-30 minutes, just until the shell starts to curl away from the nut.
4.
Transfer the nuts to a large cutting board and cover loosely with a kitchen towel. Set aside just until the nuts are cool enough to handle—the nuts will be easier to peel while they are still warm.
5.
Place the skillet on the stovetop and add the butter, cinnamon stick, salt, sugar, and nutmeg. The skillet should still be hot enough to melt the butter. Stir everything until the butter is completely melted, then transfer the butter mixture to a small bowl.
6.
Using your fingers, peel away the shells and brown skins of the chestnuts. If any brown skin clings to the nuts, a paring knife can be used to peel them away. You can choose to toss the peeled chestnuts in the melted butter, or serve the butter on the side. Serve the chestnuts while still warm.

Taking a page out of the Louisiana playbook, this turkey is rubbed all over with a fragrant, lightly spicy mix that includes paprika, cayenne pepper, coriander seed, cumin, black pepper, onion and garlic powders, and both dried oregano and dried thyme. The result is a rich, deeply flavored bird with a gorgeous rust-colored skin. It's different, yet recognizably all-American in the best sort of way.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12

1 1/2 teaspoons (3g) dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons (3g) dried oregano
1 whole turkey (12 to 14 pounds total; 5.5 to 6.3kg), butterflied according to these instructions, backbone, neck, and giblets reserved
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock
2 bay leaves","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scatter two-thirds of onions, carrots, celery, and thyme sprigs across pan. Place a wire rack directly on top of vegetables.
2.
Using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, combine paprika, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, and dried oregano. Chop or crush to a powder.
3.
Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub turkey all over with spice rub. Rub 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil all over turkey, then season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper. (If using a brined, salted, or kosher turkey, omit salting step; see note.) Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on breastbone to flatten breasts slightly.
4.
Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into deepest part of breast registers 150°F (66°C) and thighs register at least 165°F (74°C), about 1 hour 20 minutes.
5.
While turkey roasts, make jus. Roughly chop reserved neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, about 5 minutes longer. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer until reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from surface of broth. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm.
6.
When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into jus.
7.
Carve turkey and serve with jus.

For the Mushroom Sauce:
5 cups (570g) button mushrooms, washed, dried, and quartered

12 sprigs thyme, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 1/4 cups (450g) whole milk
1/2 onion (125g), peeled and roughly chopped

1 pound (454g) 90% lean ground beef
1 small (250g) onion, diced
2 cloves (8g) garlic, finely minced
1 tablespoon (8g) all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon (15g) Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons (10ml) Worcestershire sauce
To Finish:
1 pound (454g) Tater Tots, frozen or homemade
Ketchup, for serving","1.
For the Mushroom Sauce: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a large bowl, toss mushrooms with olive oil and 6 sprigs thyme, then season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spread seasoned mushrooms on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until deeply browned, about 45 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and increase oven temperature to 375°F (190°C).
2.
In a medium saucepot, combine roasted mushrooms with 6 remaining thyme sprigs, milk, onion, and garlic and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and steep, covered, for 1 hour. Strain, pressing gently on the solids.
3.
Wipe out pot and return to stovetop. Melt butter over medium heat until foaming subsides, then add flour and mix into a paste. Continue cooking until raw flour smell is gone, about 5 minutes. Whisking constantly, add mushroom-infused milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of the pot to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all milk is added.
4.
Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
5.
For the Ground Beef: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and break up into crumbles with a whisk or potato masher. Cook until well browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off any excess fat, leaving only about 1 tablespoon (15ml) in skillet along with meat.
6.
Reduce heat to medium, add onion and garlic to ground meat, and cook for about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook an additional minute, until blond. Add chicken stock and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes.
7.
Remove from heat and finish ground beef mixture with peas, corn, parsley, chives, Dijon, and Worcestershire. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Scrape meat mixture into a 2-quart baking dish.
8.
To Finish: Top meat with mushroom sauce and arrange Tater Tots on top. Bake for 30 minutes, or until Tater Tots are crispy and golden brown. Serve with squiggles of ketchup.

Classic Chiffon Cake With Vanilla Chantilly Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Few cakes are as light as chiffon, a sponge cake as billowy and soft as its name suggests. It's similar to angel food, but with the added richness of yolk and a splash of oil. This recipe strays from the norm with club soda as the liquid component, infusing the batter with plenty of fizz, for a cake that bakes up extra fluffy and tender. Whether baked in layers or a traditional tube pan, chiffon is best served fresh, with plenty of berries and cream.","Yield:Makes one 10-inch tube cake, or two 8-inch layers
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 3.8","Ingredients
For the Cake:
About 8 ounces (225g) egg white, plus or minus 1/2 ounce (15g), from 6 to 8 large eggs
10 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 1 1/3 cups plus 1 tablespoon; 285g)
3/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 4 1/2 teaspoons; 20g)
3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice (about 4 1/2 teaspoons; 20g)
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
2 teaspoons baking powder
About 4 ounces (115g) egg yolk, plus or minus 1/2 ounce (15g) from 6 to 8 large eggs
4 ounces neutral oil, such as safflower (shy 1/2 cup; 115g)
6 ounces cold seltzer or club soda, not tonic water (about 3/4 cup; 170g)
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
To Serve:
5 ounces plain or toasted sugar (shy 3/4 cup; 140g)
Heaping 1/8 teaspoon (0.6 g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
16 ounces heavy cream (about 2 cups; 450g)
2 1/2 teaspoons (12ml) vanilla extract
Fresh fruit, sprinkles, crystallized violets, or other garnishes, as desired","1.
For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low speed to loosen, about 1 minute, then increase speed to medium-low (4 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes; the whites will be dense and dark.
2.
With the mixer still running, add lemon juice and salt. Immediately increase to medium (6 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes longer; the meringue will be thin but foamy. Add the baking powder and increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid) and continue whipping until the meringue is glossy white and thick enough that you can see the pattern left by the wire whisk, but rather runny overall. This can take between 1 and 3 minutes, depending on the freshness of the whites and the horsepower of your mixer.
3.
In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks, oil, club soda, and all-purpose flour together until smooth. Pour a third of the meringue into the yolk mixture, and gently whisk until homogenous and smooth. Pour in the remaining meringue, and fold with a flexible spatula until well combined, with a uniform color. Do not continue mixing any more than strictly necessary.
4.
Scrape the soft batter into a 10-inch aluminum tube pan (do not butter or grease it in any way; do not use a nonstick pan), or two 8- by 3-inch anodized aluminum cake pans (do not line with parchment or use shallow pans). Bake until the cake is puffed, golden blonde, and firm to the touch, about 55 minutes for a 10-inch tube or 40 minutes for two 8-inch layers.
5.
Turn the hot pan(s) upside down and cool until absolutely no trace of warmth remains, at least 2 hours. Slide an offset spatula around the sides of cake(s) to loosen. For a tube pan, remove the insert and then slide the spatula under the bottom as well. For the 8-inch cakes, stand the cake pan on its side, and slide an offset spatula between the cake and the side of the pan, and gently pull to loosen the cake from the bottom; rotate the pan and continue all the way around the edges. Proceed immediately to the next step, as the cakes will dry with exposure to air.
6.
To Serve: Combine sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Mix on low for a minute to help dissolve the sugar, then whip on medium-high until the cream can hold stiff peaks; about 4 minutes. Use as a frosting for the chiffon, or to serve in dollops alongside each slice, along with fresh fruit, sprinkles, candied flowers, or whatever toppings you prefer. Wrapped tightly in plastic, the frosted chiffon can be refrigerated up to 24 hours; return to room temperature before serving.

","Sweet cornbread gets a savory touch by the additions of bacon, cheddar, and scallions. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
Bacon, cheddar, and scallions load this cornbread up with a salty, sharp, and smoky flavor. It's a great contrast to the sweet, moist bread.
Why this recipe works:
Preheating the pan and coating it with bacon grease creates the dark crusty with a light smoky, nutty flavor
Using sour cream along with buttermilk increases the mild tanginess and overall flavor of the bread
Adding a little oil to the batter results in a more cake-like moistness
Notes: This recipe results in a sweet and savory cornbread. For less sweetness, the sugar can be cut by half.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:45 minutes","Ingredients
6 slice bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons melted butter, cooled slightly
6 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup finely sliced scallions","1.
Preheat oven to 425°F. Cook bacon in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Pour bacon fat out into a small bowl. Return 2 tablespoons to pan and place pan in oven. Reserve an additional 2 tablespoons fat and discard the rest or save for another use.
2.
In a medium bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, buttermilk, eggs, 3 tablespoons melted butter, and 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat. Pour wet ingredients into bowl with dry ingredients and whisk until completely combined. Stir in bacon, cheese, and scallions.
3.
Using pot holders, carefully remove hot pan from oven. Pour in cornbread batter and place in oven. Bake until skewer inserted into middle of cornbread comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 5 minutes, then carefully turn out to wire rack and let cool an additional 10 minutes. Serve immediately. Reheat any leftover cornbread before serving again.

Triple Coconut Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This riff on the Southern classic incorporates coconut in every form, giving the cake an all-natural flavor and super-moist crumb. While it can be paired with whatever icing you prefer, I like it best with my Creamy Coconut Frosting, which is light and easy to handle. The caramelized white chocolate coconut ganache is an optional extravagance, but don't skimp on the toasted coconut!","Yield:Makes 1 (8-inch) cake, serving 16
Active time: 1 1/2 hours
Total time:4 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Cake:
16 ounces plain or toasted sugar (about 2 1/4 cups; 455g)
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 1/4 teaspoons (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), soft but cool, about 60°F (16°C)
4 ounces virgin coconut oil (about 2/3 cup; 115g), such as Vita Coco, creamy and soft, about 72°F (22°C)
3 large eggs, brought to about 65°F (18°C)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g); Tahitian works particularly well
12 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 2/3 cups, spooned; 340g) (see note)
2 ounces coconut flour (about 2/3 cup, spooned; 55g), such as Bob's Red Mill
18 ounces unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk (about 2 1/4 cups; 510g), well stirred, leftovers reserved for ganache
To Finish:
1 recipe Creamy Coconut Frosting
1 recipe Caramelized White Chocolate Ganache, made with coconut milk
7 ounces (195g) sweetened coconut flakes, lightly toasted","1.
For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here). If you don’t have three pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages; the batter will keep at room temperature until it's needed.
2.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, butter, and virgin coconut oil. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
3.
With the mixer still running, add eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, then dribble in vanilla. Pause mixing and sift together the all-purpose and coconut flours, then resume mixing on low. Sprinkle in about 1/3 of flour mixture, then drizzle in 1/3 of coconut milk. Repeat with remaining flour and coconut milk, working in thirds as before.
4.
Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68°F (18 and 20°C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.)
5.
Using a flexible spatula, fold batter once or twice from the bottom up, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 20 ounces or 565g each, if you have a scale). Stagger pans together on oven rack and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 35 minutes. If your oven heats very unevenly, pause to rotate the pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake 2 layers at once and finish the third when they’re done.
6.
Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off parchment, and return cakes right side up. (Covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours.) Prepare the frosting.
7.
For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here) and set scraps aside for snacking. Place 1 layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top cake layer with exactly 1 cup frosting, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with second and third layers, then cover sides of cake with another cup of frosting, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial here). Refrigerate cake until frosting hardens, about 30 minutes, and repeat if desired for a thicker coat. Meanwhile, prepare the ganache as directed.
8.
To Finish: Place the chilled and crumb-coated cake on a wire rack nested in a half sheet pan. Pour lukewarm ganache over the top, working from the center out to ensure even coverage. If needed, use a clean offset spatula to nudge the ganache along, or rap the pan against the countertop to create vibrations that will level the ganache. Once ganache has stopped flowing, cover top and sides of cake with toasted coconut flakes.
9.
To Serve: Let cake sit at room temperature for at least an hour before serving, or until it reaches an internal temperature of about 72°F (22°C). Cut with a chef’s knife to serve and cover the exposed edges with leftover buttercream to keep the cake moist. Under a cake dome, the cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.

Gingery Glazed Carrots Recipe,,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Note: Feel free to vary the flavorings as desired. Omit ginger and thyme and replace with other herbs or spices (orange zest works well, as does star anise, fennel, chilies, etc.). For tips on how to cut carrots, check out our Knife Skills: Carrots, and for ginger, our Knife Skills: Ginger guides. If carrots sit in the pan for too long after cooking, there's a chance the liquid will over-reduce and thicken or break. If this occurs, add a few tablespoons of hot water and stir to combine. The sauce should come back together to the right consistency.","Yield:8 to 12
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:30 minutes

3 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch disks on the bias, or faux tourné (see method here)
1 one-inch piece of ginger, peeled and cut into julienne (see method here)
4 sprigs fresh thyme
2 cups low sodium chicken broth
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice","1.
Combine carrots, ginger, thyme, chicken broth, butter, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds black pepper in a 12-inch straight-sided sautée pan or Dutch oven and place over high heat. When liquid boils, cover and cook stirring occasionally, until carrots are almost completely tender (carrots should give very little resistance when poked with a cake tester or knife), about 10 minutes. If liquid drops to below 1/2-inch during cooking, top up with a cup of hot water.
2.
Remove lid and continue cooking carrots at a rapid boil. Combine cornstarch with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and stir with a fork until homogenous. Pour cornstarch mixture into carrots and stir to combine. Continue cooking until sauce is reduced to a syrupy glaze. Pick out thyme sprigs and discard. Off heat, add lemon juice and stir to combine. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and serve.

Chatham Artillery Punch Recipe,,"[Photograph: Marleigh Riggins Miller ]
To finish off this roundup of recipes from Dave Wondrich's Punch, I have selected a monster. The big dog. The epic, party-starting, punch-to-end-all-punches: Chatham Artillery Punch.
But what is this Chatham, you ask, and why does it come bearing artillery?
In the mid-nineteenth century, an all-volunteer Savannah regiment called the Republican Blues, organized in 1808 and stationed at Fort Jackson, visited Macon. The modus operandi of many of these old Savannah units was as much social and fraternal as military, so the Blues were greeted with much fanfare by the Chatham Artillery unit. An obliging local patriot by the name of A.H. Luce ""proposed to brew a new punch in honor of the Blues,"" and the Chatham Artillery Punch was born.
There are a variety of recipes to be found for this punch—all different from this original, robust version—primarily because successive generations found its intoxicating power a little too, well, intoxicating. As Wondrich notes in this quotation from the headnote on a 1907 recipe: ""Experience has taught the rising generation to modify the receipt of their forefathers to conform to the weaker constitutions of their progeny."" (Ouch.) Most modernized Chatham Artillery recipes are weaker than the original formula, which is certainly strong enough to stand up to an artillery regiment. Or two.
This recipe makes a very large quantity of punch, so save it for a large gathering or reduce the proportions—even then, you may need to prepare a spare room for potentially tipsy travelers. You'll need a full bottle each of cognac, bourbon and rum, as well as three (yes, three) bottles of Champagne. If this is starting to sound like Jungle Juice, just bear with me. The Chatham Artillery Punch is potent for sure, but it's also delicious.
Be sure to use the best quality spirits you can to get the tastiest results. For the cognac, I used Pierre Ferrand Ambre but any good cognac or even a domestic alambic brandy like Osocalis would work; for the bourbon I used Four Roses Yellow Label, but you could also try Buffalo Trace, Russell's Reserve 6-year or, for a spicier result, Bulleit. In rum you need a Jamaican style; I used Plantation Jamaica 2000 but Appleton Estate V/X or 12-year would be nice here as well. For the sparkling wine, true French Champagne will be truly delicious—you're not just topping off with the stuff. But a good sparkling wine from elsewhere will work, too.
And finally, imbibe cautiously! As the Augusta Chronicle noted when it printed this recipe: ""As a vanquisher of men its equal has never been found.""","Yield:about 30 (6-ounce servings)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 3","Ingredients
12 lemons
2 cups light, raw sugar
750-milliliter bottle cognac
750-milliliter bottle bourbon
750-milliliter bottle Jamaica rum
3 750-milliliter bottles Champagne or sparkling wine, chilled
5 pound bag cracked ice","1.
Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, peel the lemons, being careful to remove only the yellow peel and not the bitter white pith.
2.
Place the peels in a bowl, add the sugar and muddle to combine. Set aside for at least half an hour, preferably an hour, to let the flavors combine.
3.
While the lemon peel is resting, juice the lemons to make two cups lemon juice. After the lemon peel has rested, add lemon juice to the bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Strain the mixture into an empty 750mL bottle.
4.
Add water to the bottle to fill, seal it, give it a little shake and refrigerate this shrub until you're ready to make your punch.
5.
To serve, fill your large (2.5 gallon) punch bowl with cracked ice. (At this point, move your punch bowl to its party-time location, as it will be very difficult to move when it's full of punch.)
6.
Pour the shrub and all of the bottles of cognac, bourbon, rum and sparkling wine onto the ice. Stir to combine. Serve.

Rustic Apple-Cranberry Pie Recipe,,"This rustic apple-cranberry pie requires no pie plate or pie crust shaping-skills. [Photographs: Yvonne Ruperto]
Not much can trump a freshly made fruit pie made with homemade pie dough. But let's be honest—few of us ever feel like making one. For me, a rustic pie—if you want to be fancy you can call it a galette—is a heck of a lot less stressful and no less satisfying with a deep, concentrated apple flavor dotted with tart cranberries and a warm, flaky crust that doesn't get soggy as it sits.
Why this recipe works:
Pie dough is folded up and over the fruit and baked on a baking sheet, avoiding the hassle of a shaping dough in a pie plate.
The open center of the pie allows extra moisture to escape, concentrating its flavor and keeping the crust from getting soggy.
This type of pie creates lots of crispy crust edges.
The style of this dessert is rustic, so perfection in appearance is not needed.
Notes: A pastry cutter is a tool that allows you to cut butter into a flour mixture. If you don't have one, simply rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until all of the flour is slightly moistened and there are no visible pieces of butter remaining. Make sure the flour mixture does not get too warm (refrigerate it periodically as necessary). Alternatively, you can cut the butter into the flour using a mixer. On low speed, mix with a paddle until no visible butter remains. When rolling out the dough, the edges may have a tendency to crack. Push the cracks together so that you end up with a circular piece of dough with a fairly smooth edge. If the dough begins to crack when folding over the fruit, pinch the cracks together to seal or the fruit juices will seep out when baking.","Yield:Serves 6

For the Crust:
1 1/4 cups (6 1/4 ounces) all purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
2 to 3 tablespoons ice water
For the Filling:
24 ounces (about 4 to 5 medium) baking apples such as Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, or Gala, peeled and cored, sliced into 1/2-inch wedges
1/2 cup fresh cranberries
1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) unsalted butter","1.
For the Crust:Combine flour, sugar, and salt in large bowl. Cut butter into flour using a pastry cutter or by rubbing butter into flour with fingertips (see note) until no visible pieces of butter remain. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and fold with a rubber spatula until just moistened, pressing dough against itself on the side of the bowl to form a mass of dough. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if too dry. Do not overmix. Press dough into a 5-inch disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill 1 hour.
2.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 425&degF. Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Roll dough into a 13- to 14-inch round using a lightly floured rolling pin. As your roll, press outer edges together to prevent the edges from cracking. Transfer parchment paper and dough to baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use.
3.
For the Filling: Combine apples, cranberries, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss to combine. Pile fruit filling into center of dough, leaving a perimeter of about 3 inches.
4.
Fold dough up and around the filling, trying to avoid letting the dough crack (see note). Dot the fruit with butter. Bake until crust is golden and fruit has softened, 45 to 60 minutes. Let pie cool on pan. Slice and serve. Pie can be stored loosely covered at room temperature over night.

Creamy Roasted Red Pepper and Cauliflower Soup Recipe,,"[Photographs: Deborah Mele]
Note: When puréeing your soup, you can use a food processor, blender, or hand blender. Regardless, make sure to wait until it's cooled a bit to prevent a messy explosion. I tend to divide my soups into halves or thirds to make sure it doesn't overwhelm the appliance.
Although the lemon juice may seem like a negligible amount and you therefore may be tempted to skip it, a dash of lemon juice can bring a vibrancy of flavor to many soups and really helps this one pop.
To make this soup vegetarian, use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth, and eliminate the pancetta in the garnish.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6

For the Braised Lamb:
1 1/2 teaspoons (5g) ground coriander seed
1 1/2 teaspoons (5g) ground fennel seed
3/4 teaspoon (3g) ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon (1g) smoked paprika
4 bone-in lamb shanks (about 6 pounds; 2.75kg)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoons (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more if needed
3 medium carrots (12 ounces; 250g), cut into large dice
2 large stalks celery (5 ounces; 150g), cut into large dice
1 medium yellow onion (9 ounces; 250g), cut into large dice
4 medium cloves garlic, crushed
3 oil-packed anchovy fillets, chopped
2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste
1 cup (230ml) dry white wine
4 cups (950ml) homemade or store-bought chicken stock
1 sprig rosemary
1 bay leaf
For the Herb Salad:
2 small heads (about 150g each) red and/or white endive, cored and very thinly sliced crosswise
1 large stalk celery (about 75g), sliced thinly on the bias
3 cups loosely packed herb leaves (3 ounces; 85g), such as cilantro, parsley, mint, and basil
1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh juice from 1 lemon
3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
Kosher salt","1.
For the Braised Lamb: Preheat oven to 300°F. In a small bowl, stir together coriander seed, fennel seed, cumin, and smoked paprika until thoroughly combined. Season lamb shanks all over with salt and pepper, then rub spice mixture all over meat.
2.
Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil in a large Dutch oven or roasting pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shanks, working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, and brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Reduce heat if necessary to prevent spices from scorching; add more oil if needed. Transfer browned shanks to a rimmed baking sheet.
3.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil to Dutch oven or roasting pan, along with carrots, celery, onion, and garlic, and cook over medium-high heat until vegetables are softened and just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add anchovies and tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add wine, scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan, bring to a simmer, and cook until raw alcohol smell has mostly cooked off, about 2 minutes. Arrange shanks in Dutch oven, nestling them among the vegetables; add any accumulated juices from the baking sheet to the pot. Add stock, rosemary, and bay leaf and bring to a simmer.
4.
Meanwhile, cut a piece of parchment paper just slightly smaller than the opening of the Dutch oven or roasting pan, with a hole in the center, and set it directly on top of the shanks and braising liquid. (This parchment paper lid will allow a limited amount of evaporation.) To do this, fold a large square of parchment paper in half twice. Fold the resulting square into a triangle, keeping the center of the original square at one of the acute tips of the triangle. Fold into a narrower triangle, keeping the original center of the square at the acute tip. Fold into a narrower triangle one more time. Hold the tip of the triangle over the center of the Dutch oven and trim off the back edge where it meets the edge of the pot with a pair of scissors. Cut off the tip of the triangle. Unfold the parchment, and it should fit perfectly inside the Dutch oven. Alternatively, cover the pot with a lid, leaving it partially cracked.
5.
Transfer shanks to oven and cook until very tender, about 3 hours. Discard rosemary and bay leaf.
6.
Transfer shanks to a clean rimmed baking sheet. Working in batches to prevent overfilling blender, ladle braising liquid and vegetables into a blender jar. Remove center cap of blender lid, then place lid on blender jar. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and turn blender on, starting at its lowest speed and gradually increasing to high. Blend until very smooth; for an extra-smooth texture, pass blended braising sauce through a fine-mesh strainer. Repeat with remaining braising mixture.
7.
Transfer braising sauce to a clean saucepan and season with salt and pepper. If too thick, adjust texture by thinning with water or stock; if too thin, simmer until thickened and reduced sufficiently. Baste shanks with sauce, coating them.

9 ounces sugar (about 1 1/4 cups; 255g)
8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g)
2 ounces malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farm (about 1/2 cup; 55g)
1 ounce barley malt syrup (about 4 teaspoons; 30g)

1 large egg
10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups; 280g)
10 ounces toasted pecan pieces (about 2 1/2 cups; 280g)
10 ounces roughly chopped chocolate, dark, milk, or white (about 1 3/4 cup; 280g)","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position, preheat to 350°F (170°C), and line two aluminum half sheet pans with parchment. Combine sugar, butter, malted milk powder, barley malt syrup, vanilla extract, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, increase to medium, and beat until soft and light, about 5 minutes. Add egg and continue beating until smooth, about 2 minutes more, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula as needed. Resume mixing on low, add the flour, and, when fully incorporated, add pecan pieces and chopped chocolate.
2.
With a pair of spoons, divide into about forty 1 1/4-ounce portions and arrange on half sheet pans, leaving about 2 inches in between each, as the cookies will spread significantly in the oven. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges, but still soft and pale in the middle, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on the sheet pan until firm, about 10 minutes. Enjoy warm, or allow to cool completely then store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature.
3.
If you like, portioned dough can be divided between several heavy duty zip-top bags and refrigerated up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70°F, and bake as directed.

1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces; 113g), cut into 1/2-inch pieces (see note)
1 pound (450g) small new potatoes, rinsed (see note)
Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)
2 garlic cloves (optional)
Sliced chives, for serving
Crème fraîche, for serving","1.
In a medium (3-quart) saucepan or saucier, melt butter over medium heat. Add potatoes, a healthy pinch of salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, swirling saucepan and stirring frequently with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. Make sure potatoes remain in a single, even layer in the saucepan while cooking. Continue cooking and stirring until butter begins to foam rapidly and turns golden yellow, 5 to 8 minutes.
2.
Reduce heat to medium-low; add herbs and garlic (if using). Continue stirring and turning potatoes occasionally to promote even browning. At this point, the butter should be golden brown. Regulate heat so butter simmers at a very gentle bubble and foams up when you stir it. (Depending on the strength of your burner, you may need to reduce heat from medium-low to low.) Continue cooking until potatoes are completely tender (poke a potato with a sharp paring knife or cake tester to test for doneness) and deep golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let potatoes rest for 5 minutes in the saucepan.
3.
Toss potatoes to coat them in brown butter. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a serving bowl; reserve brown butter. Drizzle as much brown butter as you like over the potatoes and sprinkle with chives (if you like) and sea salt to taste. Serve immediately with crème fraîche for dipping.

2 1/4 teaspoons whole anise seed, roughly chopped
3 large eggs, straight from the fridge (about 5 1/4 ounces; 150g)
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, chopped toasted almonds, and chopped anise seed. Mix on low until homogeneous, then add eggs and vanilla; continue to mix just long enough to form a soft dough.
2.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly to bring dough together into a ball, then shape into a roughly 8-inch log. Transfer dough log to a parchment-lined half-sheet pan and continue rolling the log by hand until it is approximately 16 inches long. Gently flatten dough by hand until log is about 4 inches wide and just over 1/2 inch thick (see note).
3.
Bake dough until puffed and firm to the touch and just beginning to brown around the very edges (though still pale overall), about 25 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board and let cool 5 minutes more. While dough is still warm, use a long, thin, and very sharp serrated knife to cut log at a slight angle into about 25 pieces, each just over 1/2 inch wide (see note).
4.
Arrange biscotti, cut sides up, on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue baking until dry to the touch and lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Flip biscotti over and continue baking for another 12 minutes. It's normal for the timing to vary according to the biscotti's size and thickness, as well as differences in oven temperature and airflow, so keep a close eye on them and adjust the bake time as needed.
5.
Cool biscotti to room temperature before serving. If desired, dip in tempered chocolate. With or without chocolate, the biscotti will keep for about 3 months in an airtight container at cool room temperature.

Classic Pulpo Gallego (Galician Octopus Tapa) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Pulpo gallego, one of the most famous tapas dishes from Spain's northwestern region of Galicia, features rounds of tender octopus topped with olive oil, salt, and Spanish smoked paprika. Here's how to make it, whether quickly with a pressure cooker or without.","Yield:Serves 4 to 8 as an hors d'oeuvre
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:45 minutes (with pressure cooker) or about 2 hours without","Ingredients
1 (2 1/2-pound; 1kg) whole octopus, rinsed well (including inside head cavity)
1 medium yellow onion, peeled and halved (optional)
3 medium cloves garlic (optional)
Kosher salt (see note)
Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
Pimentón dulce (sweet smoked Spanish paprika), to taste (see note)","1.
If Using a Pressure Cooker: Place octopus in pressure cooker and add just enough water to cover. (Be sure to keep water level below pressure cooker's maximum fill line.) Add onion and garlic, if using, along with a couple of large pinches of salt. Close pressure cooker and bring to high pressure (12 to 15 psi). Once cooker has reached high pressure, cook for 15 minutes.
2.
Using steam-release valve, depressurize cooker rapidly. Check octopus for tenderness by sliding a paring knife into the thickest part of one of its tentacles; it should slide in easily with little resistance. If octopus is not tender enough, return to high pressure and cook for 5 minutes longer. (Fifteen minutes was the correct time based on all our tests, but variations in the octopus, such as size, and in the pressure cooker used may change the cooking time slightly.) Let octopus cool slightly in its cooking liquid, then drain and discard onion and garlic. Continue with step 4.
3.
If Using a Conventional Pot: Place octopus in a large pot and add enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Add onion and garlic, if using, along with a couple of large pinches of salt. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then lower heat and continue to simmer until octopus is tender (a paring knife should slide into the thickest part of one of its tentacles easily), 1 to 2 hours. Let octopus cool slightly in its cooking liquid, then drain and discard onion and garlic.
4.
To Serve: Cut out and discard the hard beak (if it hasn't been removed already by the fishmonger), which is found in the center of the base of the octopus body, where the tentacles converge. Cut out and discard the section of the head with eyes; the rest of the head is edible. Separate tentacles into individual pieces.
5.
Cut tentacles crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds and head into small strips. Arrange on a plate in a single layer. Sprinkle salt all over, drizzle with olive oil, and dust with smoked paprika to taste. Serve.

Salted Dulce de Leche Brownies Recipe,,"Salted dulce de leche brownies. [Photographs: Nila Jones [Photograph: Nila Jones]
These rich, super fudgy brownies are topped with generous dollops of homemade dulce de leche and a generous sprinkle of sea salt. The thick layer of dulce de leche has the same fudgy texture as the brownie underneath, and the salt wakes the whole thing up. Consider yourself warned, because you're gonna want to make these every day.
Why this recipe works:
Besides granulated sugar, this recipe also calls for a fair amount of light brown sugar and corn syrup: The corn syrup makes the brownies super fudgy, while the light brown sugar intensifies the chocolate flavor.
By creaming the butter with sugar (which is not traditional for a fudgy brownie recipe) we guarantee that the dulce de leche stays on top as the brownies bake, and still get a fudgy texture at the end.","Yield:Makes 15-18 brownies

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 10- by 6-inch brownie pan and line the bottom and long sides of the pan with parchment paper.

","Extra-crispy new potatoes with a buttery, herb-flecked crust. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Simmering potatoes in heavily salted water until the water runs completely dry gives them extremely fragile, wrinkled skins that crisp up when subsequently roasted in a hot oven. The result: extra-crispy new potatoes with buttery, herb-flecked crusts.
Why this recipe works:
Simmering in heavily salted water dries out the exteriors of the potatoes and thins the skins.
Tossing with butter infused with herbs and alliums before roasting gives these potatoes deep herb flavor and crisp, buttery crusts.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10
Active time: 20 minutes

4 pounds new potatoes, scrubbed and rinsed
1/2 cup kosher salt

2 tablespoons roughly chopped chives
2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves
2 tablespoons fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 small shallot, thinly sliced
1/2 stick unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices
Freshly ground black pepper","1.
Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Add salt and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a low boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has completely evaporated and potatoes are covered in a film of salt, about 45 minutes. Drain and rinse potatoes of excess salt.
2.
While potatoes simmer, combine garlic, chives, parsley, sage, thyme, and shallot in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse, scraping down sides as necessary, until finely chopped and no large pieces remain. Scatter butter chunks on top. Pulse until homogenous paste is formed. Season generously with salt and pepper and pulse to combine. Potatoes and herb butter can be made ahead to this stage for up to 5 days before continuing.
3.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil. (If potatoes do not all fit on one rack, use two baking sheets, rotating top to bottom half way through cooking.) Heat herb butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Toss potatoes and half of melted herb butter in a large bowl to coat. Transfer to baking sheet and roast, shaking pan occasionally, until crisp all over, about 20 minutes. Re-melt remaining herb butter. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and toss with remaining herb butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper (you probably won't need any extra salt). Serve.

Transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheet. Reheat oil to 400°F and repeat with remaining sprouts and shallots.
3.
Transfer sprouts and shallots to a large bowl and add dressing. Toss to combine, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.

Homemade Wheat Thins Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This isn't a recipe for any old cracker, it's a recipe for crisp and thin whole grain crackers that taste exactly like the kind you buy at the store. My recipe hinges on using the same ingredients you find written right on the box: whole grains, oil, sugar, malt syrup, and turmeric. If you don't have any affection for genuine Wheat Thins, you can get away with a substitution or two, but for those of you who want to make a worthy copy at home, it's vital to use the right ingredients. Trust me, it's worth the effort.","Yield:Makes 140 small crackers
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:75 minutes
Rated: 5","Ingredients
For the Glaze:
2 ounces light corn syrup (about 3 tablespoons; 55g)
1/4 ounce barley malt syrup (about 1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1 ounce hot water (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)
For the Crackers:
5 ounces whole wheat flour, plus more for dusting (about 1 cup, spooned; 140g)
2 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1/3 cup; 70g)
1 1/2 ounces bread flour (about 1/4 cup, spooned; 40g)
3/4 ounce toasted wheat germ (about 3 tablespoons; 20g)
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 ounce refined coconut oil, solid but creamy (about 2 tablespoons; 30g)
1/4 ounce barley malt syrup (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7g)
3 ounces water (about 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 85g)","1.
For the Glaze: Combine corn syrup, malted barley syrup, and salt in a small bowl, then add hot water and stir with a fork until the salt is dissolved. Set aside to cool.
2.
For the Crackers: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, preheat to 350°F, and cut two parchment sheets to 11- by 16-inches. Combine whole wheat flour, sugar, bread flour, wheat germ, salt, turmeric, cream of tartar, baking soda, and coconut oil in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until coconut oil disappears into a fine, powdery meal. Mix barley malt and water in a small glass to dissolve the syrup, then add to dry mix and process to form a stiff dough. Knead lightly on an unfloured surface, then divide in half and drape with a damp paper towel.
3.
To Roll: Place a prepared parchment sheet on a clean work surface, and dust generously with whole wheat flour. Place one portion of dough in the center, sprinkle with flour, and, using a rolling pin, roll into a roughly 5- by 8-inch rectangle. Dust with flour and carefully flip the dough over, sprinkling more flour on top, wherever you notice a sticky patch. Continue rolling from the center out, until the dough extends just past the edges of the parchment and is no thicker than 1/16 inch; the crackers will puff significantly in the oven, so this thinness is key to keeping them thin and crisp.
4.
To Glaze and Cut: Trim away the ragged edges with a pizza wheel, and lightly brush the dough with glaze. If you like, use a docking tool to decorate the crackers. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares with a pizza wheel (they will shrink in the oven), then carefully transfer the parchment and crackers to an aluminum half sheet pan. This can be done by lifting two opposite corners and pulling the paper taut, or by sliding the parchment and crackers on and off a pizza peel.
5.
To Bake: Sprinkle with salt and bake the crackers to a light yellow-brown, about 12 minutes, rotating the sheet pan halfway through to ensure even browning in the ultra-thin dough. The bake-time is highly variable, depending on the exact thickness of the dough, the type of baking sheet used, and any variations in dough thickness. Keep a close eye on the crackers as they bake, as they may brown and crisp faster depending on these variables. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheet; the crackers will not be crisp while warm. Repeat with the remaining dough (if rolled/cut in advance, the crackers won't shrink away from each other as they should). Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature up to one month.

Rillettes are an entertainer's godsend. They're cheap, they're delicious, and they sound fancy. Most importantly, they seem like the kind of thing that takes a lot of skill and training to make, and yet nothing could be further from the truth. It's hard to think of an hors d'oeuvre that's easier to make in bulk. If you've ever wanted to dip your toes into the waters (or should I say warm rendered fats?) of French charcuterie, or if you're really in the mood to impress your friends and family with little to no effort, rillettes are the place to start.","Yield:Serves 12 to 16 as an appetizer
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:4 hours, plus at least 2 hours chilling
Rated: 5","Ingredients
2 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks (about 1kg)
Kosher salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil, lard, or duck fat (120ml)
4 bay leaves
6 fresh thyme sprigs
2 large shallots, very roughly chopped
4 medium cloves garlic, split in half
Freshly ground nutmeg, to taste","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Season pork gently with salt and pack into a Dutch oven, roasting pan, or casserole dish. It should fit in a layer about 2 inches deep. Pour oil over the pork (if using lard or duck fat, heat until just melted before pouring over pork). Nestle bay leaves, thyme sprigs, shallots, and garlic in with the pork. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil, transfer to oven, and cook until pork is completely tender and shows very little resistance when pierced with a knife, about 3 hours.
2.
Remove from oven and using tongs, discard bay leaves, thyme, shallots, and garlic. Set a large strainer over a heatproof bowl and carefully pour pork mixture into it. Reserve drained fat and juices.
3.
Transfer pork chunks to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (see note). Turn mixer on to low speed and gradually increase speed to medium, allowing pork to break down and shred. Slowly drizzle in the fat and juices a few tablespoons at a time, tasting in between each addition until the mixture is as loose and creamy as you like it. Season to taste aggressively with salt (the mixture will get more bland as it chills, so add salt until it almost tastes too salty).
4.
Carefully pack mixture into jars, spooning it in a little bit at a time and making sure to remove all air bubbles. Smooth tops of mixture with the back of a spoon, wipe rims of jars with a clean cloth, then pour a quarter inch of fat on top of each one. Close lids and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to a week before serving. Serve lightly chilled with bread or crackers and cornichons, whole grain mustard, and fruit preserves. Rillettes can also be frozen directly in their jars and held for several months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight before serving.

Slow and Easy Panettone Recipe,,"A slow-risen, buttermilk panettone that's really worth eating. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Of all the holiday breads that pop-up around this time of year, panettone is the stand out. Boozy, sweet, and ubiquitous, it can be found at grocery stores and bakeries everywhere. Many times, however, the panettone available in stores is far from fresh, and contains lots of unseemly preservatives. It can also be exorbitantly expensive to buy one that's any good.
Why let something so happy become a source of sadness? This is the year to stop buying it, and start making it at home. The recipe that follows is as giving as it is easy and adaptable. Don't like hazelnuts? Try almonds. Bad whiskey experience in high school? Use calvados. Cramped for oven space on Christmas day? Make it a day or two ahead of time...this recipe has a great shelf life. Want chocolate in it? Or pistachios? Or to put streusel on top? Make this recipe yours.
Why this recipe works:
Traditionally, panettone dough is an acidified, wild-yeasted relative of babka, brioche, and kugelhopf. The recipe below uses pre-fermented buttermilk and a slow rise as substitutes for sourdough, offering a similar tang to the dough without having to cultivate a wild-yeast culture.
The buttermilk-biga offers the dough an earthy, nutty quality, which pairs outstandingly with the toasted hazelnuts and tart cherries.
The sugar, butter, buttermilk, and alcohol in this recipe are natural preservatives, keeping your panettone moist for days.
Note: This recipe calls for metric weights for precision. It requires the use of a good digital scale like the OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Digital Scale with Pull-Out Display.","Yield:Makes 1 large panettone, or 2 small ones
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:24 to 30 hours
Rated: 4.6666666666667","Ingredients
400 grams All-Purpose Flour (divided)
175 grams Cultured Buttermilk, divided
125 grams Egg Yolks
200 grams Dried Cherries
100 grams Bourbon
75 grams Hazelnuts, crushed and toasted
75 grams Sugar
12 grams Salt
10 grams plus a pinch Instant Yeast
150 grams Butter, cold but softened
1 egg
Zest of 1 lemon","1.
For the Biga: The night before you plan to bake, combine 200 grams of flour, 125 grams of buttermilk, and a small pinch of yeast in a medium bowl with your hands until all of the flour and yeast is hydrated and no clumps remain. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours. The biga should double in size.
2.
For the Soaker: At least a day before you plan to bake, combine the dried cherries, bourbon and lemon zest. Allow to sit, covered, at room temperature overnight until the fruit absorbs the alcohol. Shake periodically to make sure your cherries hydrate evenly.
3.
For the Dough: Place the remaining 200 grams flour, all of the biga, the egg yolks, the remaining 50 grams buttermilk, and the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until the dough is fully incorporated and smooth. About 4 minutes.
4.
When the initial mix has come fully together into a smooth ball, add the salt and sugar. Continue mixing on slow speed until the dough is once again smooth, about 4 minutes.
5.
When the dough has once again come together, turn the mixer to medium-high speed and knead until the dough forms a slightly stiff, but stretchy and elastic ball, about 4 minutes.
6.
Return the mixer to slow speed and add the butter in small pieces. Mix until butter is fully incorporated into dough, scraping down the sides of the work bowl with a spatula as necessary. When the butter is fully incorporated, the dough should feel looser, and stretchier than before, but not greasy. About 10 minutes. If the dough continues to feel greasy but you can't see any pieces of butter in the bowl, allow dough to continue to mix on slow speed until the oily feel has fully dissipated, up to 5 minutes longer.
7.
With the butter is fully incorporated, drain any excess liquid from the soaked cherries. Add the cherries and toasted hazelnuts to the dough. Mix low speed until your dough re-forms into a coherent ball with cherries and nuts evenly distributed throughout.
8.
Using a dough spatula, transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface, shape into a ball, and place the ball seam-side down into the panettone mold. If you wish to make smaller panettona, divide dough now into the number of pieces you desire and place into appropriately sized molds. The ball of dough should fill somewhere between a quarter and a third of the mold.
9.
Beat egg well and brush over the top of the panettone. Lightly but securely cover your filled panettone mold with plastic wrap. Allow to proof in a warm, slightly humid place until the dough fills the mold roughly 2/3 high, 10 to 12 hours.
10.
1 hour before you plan to bake, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (325°F for a convection oven). When the panettone is appropriately risen, apply a second coat of egg wash, place it on a rimmed baking sheet, and place in oven.
11.
Bake the panettone until the tops are a deep, golden brown, and a pastry tester or knife pushed into the center comes out clean, approximately 45 minutes, rotating the loaf midway through the bake.
12.
When done, allow to cool for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Stored in a plastic bag, the panettone will stay moist and fresh for at least 4 days.

Flaky and Crisp Gluten-Free Pie Crust Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This buttery dough bakes up tender and golden brown—perfect for all your favorite pies. The trick is xanthan gum, which adds strength and elasticity to the dough. Just take your time and work in stages, and your patience will be rewarded with a dough that's flaky, crisp, and beautiful to behold.","Yield:Makes 2 single- or 1 double-crusted 9-inch pie (regular or deep-dish)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:2 1/2 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
4 ounces white rice flour (3/4 cup; 113g)
2 1/2 ounces cornstarch (1/2 cup; 70g), plus more for dusting
1 1/2 ounces tapioca flour (1/3 cup; 42g)
1 ounce coconut flour (1/4 cup; 28g)
1/2 ounce sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g), cold
4 ounces cold water (1/2 cup; 115g)","1.
For the Dough: Whisk white rice flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, coconut flour, sugar, salt, and xanthan gum together in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces. With your fingertips, smash each cube into a thin sheet—that's it! Stir in water, then knead dough against the sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball.
2.
Make the Layers: On a very generously dusted work surface, gently roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch rectangle, sprinkling more cornstarch above and below to prevent sticking. Don't be shy! Fold the 10-inch sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book. Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block. The dough will crack along the creases, but that's just fine. Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper. If dough is very soft or if you are working in a hot kitchen, refrigerate for 15 minutes before continuing.
3.
For Single-Crusted Pies: Using as much cornstarch as needed, gently roll one piece into a 12-inch circle. Slide an offset spatula underneath it to loosen, then divide into quarters. Transfer to the pie plate one at a time, folding the top edge of each piece over to create a thick border that sits atop the rim of the pan. Press and pinch dough together along the seams to form a unified whole. Repeat with remaining dough. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.
4.
For a Double-Crusted Pie: Shape one piece of dough according to the directions above. For a solid top crust, roll remaining dough the same way, or roll into a 9- by 15-inch rectangle for a lattice-top pie. Divide into manageable pieces and transfer to a baking sheet or parchment-lined cutting board. (The parchment will prevent dough from absorbing any savory odors from the board.) Wrap both portions in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.

","Plump and juicy, with chunks of shrimp barely visible through translucent dough, har gow are one of the most widely recognized dim sum classics. Ours enhance the shrimp with bits of pork fat in a stretchy, delicate wrapper.
If you're not used to pleating dumpling skins, wrapping it can be a little tricky (see this post for instructions on folding purse-shaped dumplings). An alternative way, outlined in this recipe, is to do a simple half-moon wrap and just crimp the edges with a fork.
Why this recipe works:
Marinating the shrimp with baking soda helps keep them plump and crisp as they steam.
Pork fat back adds plenty of moisture to the mix.
A hot water dough made with pure wheat starch is easily malleable and forms a translucent shell when steamed.
Note: Wheat starch is available in Asian grocers or you can order it online from Amazon. To freeze the dumplings, place the dumplings on a sheet pan or a flat surface lined with wax paper. Make sure dumplings are not touching each other. Freeze in the freezer until hard, about 1 hour. Once they are frozen, you can store them in ziplock bags or in another sealed container. Cook the dumplings straight from the freezer following directions in step 8.","Yield:Makes 25 dumplings

1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon Shaoxing wine
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch
Black vinegar for serving","1.
For the Dough: Bring ½ cup of water to boil. In a bowl, add wheat starch, tapioca flour/starch, and salt. Mix the dry ingredients together. Add the oil and the boiling water. With a spatula, mix until a loose dough is form. Turn the dough out onto a table and knead until a smooth ball is formed. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature.

Meanwhile, fill a small pot halfway with water and bring it to a boil. Add fatback and boil for 10 minutes. Drain fatback on paper towels and let cool. When the fatback is cool to the touch, remove the skin (if the skin is attached) and mince the fat. Set aside.
4.
After 30 minutes in the refrigerator, drain and rinse shrimp under cold running water, then pat dry with paper towels. Chop shrimp into 4 to 5 pieces and place in a bowl. Add minced fatback, minced ginger, minced garlic, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, ground white pepper, oil, and cornstarch. Mix well and set aside in the refrigerator.
5.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap to prevent drying and set aside. Roll the other half into a long rope. Cut the dough into 12 portions, about 1/4 ounce each. Using a small rolling pin on a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough into a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Continue with the rest of the portions and the other half of the dough, covering the finished wrappers in plastic wrap as you work. Cover the wrappers with plastic wrap until ready to fill.
6.
To fill the wrappers, place 3 to 4 pieces of shrimp with the fatback in the middle of one wrapper. Fold one side of the wrapper onto the other side forming a half moon.
7.
Using a small fork, crimp the edge. Set aside on top of parchment paper. (see note for freezing instructions.)
8.
To cook the dumplings, set up a steamer. Make sure to line the steaming surface with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent the dumplings from sticking. Steam each batch of dumplings over high heat for 7 minutes, or 9 minutes if they are coming straight from the freezer. Let the dumplings rest for 1 minute and serve with black vinegar.

Beet and Wheat Berry Salad With Pickled Apples and Pecans Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The key to make-ahead salads like this one is to use ingredients that can hold their shape and freshness over time. That means lettuces are out. In this hearty option, we combine chewy whole red winter wheat, roasted beets and their sautéed greens, pickled apples, and toasted pecans. It's a perfect, filling vegetarian option for autumn and winter tables.","Yield:Serves 8 to 12
Active time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 4.25","Ingredients
1 1/2 cups whole red winter wheat berries or other whole grain (12 ounces; 340g) (see note)
Kosher salt
3 1/2 pounds (1.5kg) beet roots with their greens, roots and leafy stalks separated, 8 ounces' (225g) worth of leaves and stalks washed and chopped coarsely, remainder reserved for another use (see note)
1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
2 medium cloves garlic, minced
1 cup white wine vinegar (8 ounces; 235ml)
2 tablespoons (25g) sugar
2 sprigs tarragon
3/4 pound (340g) very crisp apples, such as Honeycrisps, cored and diced
4 medium shallots, minced (6 ounces; 170g)
1 1/2 cups pecans (6 ounces; 170g), toasted and roughly crumbled
1 recipe Simple Vinaigrette","1.
Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). In a medium pot, add wheat berries and cover by at least 2 inches of cold water. Add enough salt to taste, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until berries are tender with a pleasant chewiness, about 1 1/2 hours. Drain and set aside or place in refrigerator.
2.
Place trimmed beet roots in a roasting pan, add a couple of tablespoons of water, and drizzle with enough olive oil to coat each beet root. Cover pan with aluminum foil and roast until beets are easily pierced by a fork or paring knife, about 1 hour. Let cool.
3.
Peel beets, trim ends, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. (The peels should rub off fairly easily with paper towels; if desired, wear latex gloves when peeling red beets to prevent staining fingers.) Set aside or place in refrigerator.
4.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 30 seconds. Add chopped beet greens and stems and cook, stirring often, until leaves are fully wilted and stalks are tender, about 10 minutes. Lower heat if necessary to prevent scorching. Season with salt. Set aside or place in refrigerator.
5.
In a medium saucepan, combine white wine vinegar with 1 cup (235ml) water, sugar, 1 teaspoon (4g) kosher salt, and tarragon sprigs. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt.
6.
Place apples and shallots in a stainless steel mixing bowl nested in a larger mixing bowl full of ice water. Pour hot vinegar brine over apples, stirring to chill rapidly. Once cool, discard tarragon and press a clean paper towel against the surface to fully submerge apples. Set aside or place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
7.
When ready to assemble, drain apples and shallots. Combine cooked wheat berries, diced beets, sautéed beet greens, pickled apples and shallots, and toasted pecans in a large serving bowl. Toss well. Dress with enough vinaigrette to coat, drizzling on extra olive oil at any point to refresh salad if it appears dry. Season with salt and serve.
8.
To Make Ahead: Salad components can each be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated separately until ready to combine and serve. This salad can also be assembled fully in advance, as it improves with time as the wheat berries absorb flavors from the dressing and other ingredients. If desired, assemble up to 3 days in advance and keep refrigerated. (Red beets will stain everything more if salad is assembled in advance, but otherwise there are no downsides.)

"Fall Harvest Salad With Roasted Brassicas, Fingerlings, and Radishes Recipe",,"A robust holiday salad that can be made in advance, won't wilt once dressed, and is guaranteed to impress. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
A fancy fall salad that won't add to your holiday stress. Made with roasted brassicas, potatoes, radishes, and sunchokes plus frisee and radicchio, this dish can be prepped ahead with no loss in quality. Plus, it hardly wilts once dressed!
Why this recipe works:
Hearty vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, radishes, frisee, and radicchio can be prepared in advance and won't wilt quickly once tossed with the dressing.
Using radishes and sunchokes both roasted and raw gets lots of texture and flavor mileage out of just two ingredients.
Note: The roasted brassicas, boiled whole potatoes, and dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated; let come to room temperature before finishing salad and serving. Sunflower seeds can be toasted up to 5 days in advance and held in an airtight container. Frisee, parsley leaves, and radicchio can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated in airtight containers with a moist (but not wet) paper towels. Sliced raw radishes can be held in water in the refrigerator for 1 day; sliced raw sunchokes can be held in water with lemon juice in the refrigerator for 1 day. Use whichever brassicas you can find—halved Brussels sprouts would be great here in place of the romanesco if you can't find it.","Yield:Serves 6 to 10 as a side

Perfect Meringue Mushrooms Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik. Video: Serious Eats]
Meringue mushrooms are a delightful finishing touch for Christmas Yule logs, or bûches de Noël. With toasted sugar, cream of tartar, plenty of salt, and ample vanilla, these mushrooms have real flavor and character to back up their cute appearance. To complete the look (and taste!) of these fanciful meringue cookies, dust them with a high-fat cocoa powder, and reach for your favorite dark or milk chocolate to ""glue"" the caps and stems together; see note. And remember, the ""mushrooms"" can only taste as good as the ingredients involved!","Yield:about 2 dozen meringue mushrooms
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:about 7 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
6 ounces egg whites (2/3 cup; 170g), from 5 to 6 large eggs
9 ounces toasted sugar (1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon; 255g) (see note)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon; about 15g) vanilla extract, or more to taste
4 ounces finely chopped dark or milk chocolate (about 2/3 cup; 115g)","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions, and preheat the oven to 225°F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment, and fit two large pastry bags with plain, round tips (we recommend using one 1/2-inch round tip and one 1/4-inch round tip to create mushroom caps and stems, both large and small). Twist the tip so the narrow end of the bag twists closed, then tuck a bit of the bag into the tip to ""seal"" so the meringue won't flow out prematurely. Slide each prepared pastry bag into a large pilsner glass (or a similarly tall, narrow container), and roll the opening of the bag over the rim of the glass, so it stands open and easy to fill.
2.
For a Stand Mixer With a Bowl-Lift Design: Tear off a long strip of foil and crumple it into a thick ring. Place it in the bottom of a 3-quart saucier, or similarly large, wide pot, and fill with roughly 1 1/2 inches water. Place over high heat until bubbling-hot, then adjust the temperature to maintain a gentle simmer. In a stainless steel stand mixer bowl, combine egg whites, toasted sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Set over the steaming water so that the bowl is resting on the foil ring and touching neither the water nor the pot itself. Cook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites register 175°F (79°C) on a digital thermometer; this should take no longer than 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.
3.
For a Stand Mixer With a Tilt-Head Design: Fill a large pot with a few inches of water. Place over high heat until bubbling-hot. In a large heatproof glass or ceramic bowl, combine egg whites, toasted sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Set bowl over the steaming water, then cook, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, until egg whites register 175°F (79°C) on a digital thermometer; this should take no longer than 10 minutes. Scrape mixture into the stand mixer bowl and fit stand mixer with a whisk attachment.
4.
Preparing the Meringue: Whip the meringue on high speed until glossy, stiff, and thick, about 5 minutes (the timing can vary substantially depending on the equipment involved, so use the textural cues as your primary guide). When well-whipped, reduce speed to medium-low and add vanilla extract. Adjust salt and vanilla to taste, bearing in mind the meringue will taste less sweet once it has baked. Transfer the meringue to the prepared piping bags and have a small dish of water nearby.
5.
For the Mushroom Caps: Hold the piping bag perpendicular to the parchment-lined sheet pan, with the piping tip about 1/4- to 1/2-inch above its surface. For flat, shiitake-like mushrooms, don't lift or move the bag whatsoever, simply squeeze firmly so the meringue is piped out in a disc-like shape; be sure to stop squeezing before moving the tip away when finished (a quick, lateral move left or right will make a clean break). For rounder, button mushroom–like shapes, slowly lift the piping bag while squeezing, then stop squeezing before moving the tip away. Repeat until the tray is filled with ""caps"" in assorted sizes and shapes, leaving at least 1/2-inch between each cap.
6.
Dip your index finger in the dish of water, then smooth and flatten the pointed peak of each cap, re-wetting your fingertip between each one. This process may create wrinkles and folds in the meringue, and residual moisture can result in water spots, contributing a more organic appearance in the finished mushroom.
7.
For Mushroom Stems: Hold the piping bag perpendicular to the parchment-lined sheet pan, with the piping tip about 1/4-inch above its surface. Begin squeezing out the meringue, while slowly lifting the bag straight up; when the stem has reached the desired length, stop squeezing and lift the bag straight up until the meringue breaks away. Stems in assorted widths and heights can be created by varying the speed of piping and lifting. If you like, the stems can be piped at slight angles, or with a slightly spiraled effect, to create a wider array of shapes. Repeat until the tray is filled with ""stems,"" leaving at least 1/2-inch between each one. As with the caps, the mushroom stems can be molded, adjusted, or smoothed with a wet fingertip. Don't worry if any stems fall over or lean to one side or show water spots, as all of these ""defects"" will give the finished mushrooms a more organic appearance.
8.
Baking the Meringues: Place both trays of meringue in the oven. Bake until the caps and stems feel dry to the touch and peel easily from the parchment when lifted away, although a firm squeeze may reveal their interior texture to still be quite soft. This slow-bake should take about 3 hours but can vary depending on the accuracy of the oven as well as the exact number and size of the mushroom pieces. In ovens with uneven heat, rotate the sheet pans and switch their positions about halfway through. At the end of baking, the meringues will have taken on a light ivory to beige color.
9.
Shut off the heat and allow the meringues to cool to inside the oven until they reach cool room temperature, no warmer than 70°F/21°C. The timing will vary depending on the oven's age and design, but expect between 3 to 5 hours; cooling can also be done overnight. In either case, should the meringues still feel tacky and soft after cooling, return the oven temperature to 225°F and bake another hour, before cooling to room temperature once more.
10.
Coloring the Meringues: Once the meringues have cooled, lightly dust each tray with a high-fat cocoa powder, whether natural or Dutch. Next, use your fingers to rub the cocoa powder into the caps and stems, until each has darkened to a rustic brown. Repeat as needed or as desired to achieve whatever coloration you like. As a rule, the mushrooms tend to look more realistic when the caps are darker than the stems. Cover the caps and stems tightly with plastic or transfer to an airtight container, until needed, up to one week at cool room temperature. Please bear in mind that if the container is not truly airtight, the meringues may turn soft and tacky over time.
11.
Assembling the Mushrooms: Temper the chocolate according to whichever method you prefer (see our complete guide to tempering). Spread a small quantity of tempered chocolate onto the bottom of a mushroom cap, then dip the very tip of a mushroom stem into the chocolate as well, and join the pieces together, gently twisting the stem against the cap to secure. Arrange the assembled mushroom upside down on the empty baking sheet, pressing the stem firmly into the cap if it seems unstable.
12.
Continue until all the mushrooms have been assembled; if needed, stems that jut out at odd angles can be balanced against the rim of the baking sheet or against the cap or stem of another mushroom. Don't worry if the stems shift or lean slightly to one side, as this will only give the mushrooms a more natural appearance in the end, but do re-adjust any stems that fall over altogether.
13.
When the chocolate has hardened, transfer the mushrooms to an airtight container until needed (the mushrooms can be held up to one week at cool room temperature). As the mushrooms will soften over time in a humid environment, it's best to keep them in the container as long as possible, bringing them out to garnish a Yule log at the last possible moment, rather than in advance. How long the mushrooms will stay crisp and dry will vary depending on relative humidity. In dry conditions, they may keep well for several hours; in humid environments (particular in a kitchen with a stovetop in use for boiling or simmering), they may begin to soften in less than an hour.
14.
Troubleshooting: While the approximate cooking times for the water bath are estimations and will naturally vary from kitchen to kitchen, substantially missing the mark in terms of timing indicates heat levels that are vastly too high or low. When the meringue cooks much too fast, it is prone to scrambling, regardless of how thoroughly the bowl is scraped, resulting in a lumpy texture and eggy flavor. When the meringue is cooked too slowly, excess evaporation will dry the meringue, making it grainy and dense. In either event, adjusting the heat as needed will prevent the issue from arising in the first place.
Chocolate that has been melted but not tempered (or chocolate that has been badly tempered) may fail to set at room temperature. In this case, cover the tray of assembled mushrooms in plastic, and refrigerate until the chocolate hardens. Transfer to an airtight container, and refrigerate until needed (up to one week).

To Finish:
Roughly 9 ounces Homemade Cool Whip, Cherry Pit Whipped Cream, or your favorite frosting (1 3/4 cups; 255g)","1.
Preheat oven to 350°F and line 2 aluminum half sheet pans with parchment, trimming as needed so it lies perfectly flat. Whisk hot coffee or tea with chopped chocolate and cocoa in a medium bowl until smooth. Combine butter, brown sugar, baking powder, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed to moisten. Increase to medium and cream until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes, pausing at the halfway point to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. While still mixing, add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low and add 1/3 of flour, followed by 1/3 of the chocolate paste. Alternate between the two, forming a chocolaty batter. Fold once or twice from the bottom up to ensure no streaks of flour or butter remain. Transfer half of batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8- or 1/2-inch round tip.

Dab a little batter under each corner of parchment, then press firmly to secure it to sheet pans. Pipe about fifteen 2 3/4-inch by 1-inch ""buns"" onto each sheet pan, refilling the bag when needed. Bake until ""buns"" are puffy and firm, about 8 minutes. Slide parchment onto the counter and cool until no trace of warmth remains. Use immediately or transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer; store at room temperature up to 24 hours.
3.
To Finish: Transfer Homemade Cool Whip, Cherry Pit Whipped Cream, or your favorite whipped frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8- or 1/2-inch round tip. Flip half the ""buns"" upside down and pipe about 1 tablespoon of filling down the center of each. Top with remaining ""buns"" and press gently to secure. Enjoy immediately, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 6 hours.

Charred-Lemon Gin Sparkler Recipe,,"[Photograph: Autumn Giles]
The caramel depth and toned-down tartness of seared lemon is a total game-changer in this make-ahead gin cocktail that's great for crowds.
Why this recipe works:
Searing the lemon halves before juicing mellows their acidity and transforms their flavor into something richer.
Chilling the mixer base lets you mix up a big batch ahead of time and gives the rosemary time to infuse.
A complex, botanical-rich gin like Botanivore from St. George Spirits makes this drink with a simple ingredient list anything but predictable.","Yield:makes 12 servings
Active time: 5 minutes
Total time:10 minutes

","The classic flavors of Twix improved with better ingredients. [Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Twix have always been my favorite candy bar, but it's easy to see where there's room for improvement. This recipe replicates the familiar flavors of the chocolate-covered caramel-and-shortbread cookies, but with high quality dark chocolate, buttery homemade caramel, and crisp, flavor-packed shortbread cookies.
Why this recipe works:
Combining oat flour, corn starch, and regular all-purpose flour gives us shortbread cookies with a crisp texture and plenty of flavor.
Real butter, cream, and brown sugar make for a flavorful caramel. It stays soft with the help of corn syrup.
Tempering the chocolate with either a food processor or a sous-vide circulator ensures excellent snap and texture in the finished cookie.","Yield:Makes about 24 cookies
Active time: 2 hours
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 3.6666666666667","Ingredients
For the Shortbread Cookies:
2.5 ounces (1/2 cup) steel-cut oats
7.5 ounces (1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
1.5 ounces (1/4 cup) cornstarch
3 ounces (2/3 cup) confectioner’s sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 ounces (14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon-sized pats
For the Caramel Filling:
6 ounces (about 3/4 cup) sweetened condensed milk
3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter
4 ounces (about 1/2 cup) white granulated sugar
4 ounces (about 1/2 cup) dark brown sugar
4 ounces (about 1/2 cup) corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 ounces (about 1/4 cup) water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Chocolate Coating:
24 ounces bittersweet chocolate disks, chips, or roughly smashed bars
Coarse sea salt such as Maldon","1.
For the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F. Place oats in a spice grinder or blender and process to a fine flour, about 1 minute. Combine oat flour, regular flour, cornstarch, confectioner's sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until combined, about 15 seconds. Add butter and beat on low speed until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the mixer, about 12 minutes. Transfer dough to a parchment-lined work surface.
2.
Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and flatten slightly. Lay a second sheet of parchment on top. Using a rolling pin, roll dough to an even layer about 3/16th of an inch thick.
3.
Cut out as many circles as you can using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Cut a second circle out of the center of half of them using a 2 1/4-inch cookie cutter.
4.
Transfer the whole circles to a parchment-lined baking sheet with a thin metal spatula (there should be room for about 24 circles on the sheet). Top each circle of dough with one of the punched out rings of dough, pressing down slightly to adhere. Prick the center of each cookie four times with a toothpick or wooden skewer to dock. Gather any dough scraps and repeat rolling, cutting and transferring process until 24 full cookies are formed. Discard or reserve remaining dough for another use.
5.
Bake cookies for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 300°F and continue baking until cookies are pale golden brown around the edges, about 15 minutes longer, rotating pan half way through cooking. Remove from oven, transfer to a wire rack set in a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, and set aside to cool.
6.
For the Caramel: Combine condensed milk, butter, both sugars, corn syrup, salt, and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant rubber spatula or spoon. When mixture reaches 245°F on an instant-read thermometer, immediately remove from heat and transfer mixture to a 2-cup liquid measure.
7.
Carefully spoon caramel into the center of each cookie, letting it rise slightly above the lip of the shortbread ring. Excess caramel can be poured into a lightly buttered baking dish, cooled completely at room temperature, turned out of dish, and cut into individual caramel candies.
8.
For the Chocolate: Allow caramel to cool while you prepare the chocolate. Remove 1/4 up of chocolate and set aside. Place remaining chocolate in a microwave-safe container and microwave in 15 second intervals, stirring after each one, until chocolate is completely melted and registers 115°F on an instant-read thermometer (do not overheat). Add half of reserved chocolate to bowl and stir vigorously with a rubber spatula. Continue stirring and adding reserved chocolate a bit at a time until temperature drops to between 84 and 86°F. Return to microwave and microwave at 10-second intervals, stirring vigorously in between, until chocolate registers 90°F. Be careful not to heat past 94°F. (If chocolate heats past 94°F, reheat to 115°F and repeat this step. See here for instructions on how to temper chocolate using a sous-vide cooker or a food processor with a hair dryer.)
9.
Pour or spoon melted chocolate over cookies, letting excess drip through cooling rack. Set aside for 1 minute, then sprinkle a small amounf ot coarse sea salt on the center of each cookie. Let chocolate harden to room temperature for 10 minutes, transfer to refrigerator for 10 minutes, then remove cookies from wire rack using a thin metal spatula. Store in a covered container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

E.L. Fudge-Style Chocolate and Vanilla Sandwich Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
With crisp and crunchy vanilla wafers sandwiching a dark-chocolate cream filling, these shortbread cookies taste as magical as if they'd been prepared by an elf. Of course, they can be made with whatever cookie cutters you have on hand, but when it comes to whipping up a batch of copycat E.L. Fudge, owl fudge cookies sound just about right.","Yield:Makes about 24 (1- by 3-inch) cookies
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour 15 minutes
Rated: 4","Ingredients
For the Cookies:
3 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1/2 cup; 100g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
4 ounces unsalted butter (about 8 tablespoons; 115g), pliable but cool
1 ounce milk (about 2 tablespoons; 30g), any percentage will do
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 15g)
7 3/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 3/4 cups, spooned; 220g), plus more for dusting
For the Filling:
4 ounces powdered sugar (about 1 cup, spooned; 110g)
1 ounce Dutch-process cocoa powder (about 1/4 cup, spooned; 30g), such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute
3 ounces unsalted butter (about 6 tablespoons; 85g), brought to about 72°F (22°C)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
For the Cookies: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine sugar, salt, baking powder, and butter. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase to medium speed and cream until soft and light, about 5 minutes. Scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Add about half of milk and vanilla; once incorporated, add about half of flour. Repeat with remaining liquid and dry ingredients, then scrape bowl and beater once more to make sure dough is well mixed.
2.
On a generously floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-inch thickness, using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into shapes with a cutter averaging about 2 1/2 inches in size (see note) and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead briefly, roll, and cut as before. Bake cookies until firm to the touch and light brown all over, about 16 minutes; if needed, rotate pan halfway through to ensure even browning. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue to step 3, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature.
3.
For the Filling: Sift powdered sugar and cocoa together. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine soft butter, vanilla, and salt with about 1/3 of the sugar-cocoa mixture. Mix at low speed until dry ingredients are moistened, then add another 1/3 of sugar/cocoa and slowly increase to medium speed. Once sugar/cocoa is incorporated, reduce speed to low and add remaining mixture. Slowly increase to medium speed, then pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula and resume mixing until creamy and smooth. (When the butter is too cold, the filling may seem stiff or thick, so take care to start with soft butter.) Transfer to a disposable pastry bag and snip the end to create a 1/4-inch opening.
4.
To Assemble the Cookies: Flip half of cookies upside down and pipe on approximately 1/4 ounce filling (no need to measure; this can be done by eye). Once half the cookies have been ""filled,"" any excess filling can be redistributed as needed. Top with remaining cookies and transfer finished sandwich cookies to an airtight container.
5.
Refrigerate cookies 15 minutes to harden filling. If temperatures in your kitchen routinely climb above 70°F (21°C), the cookies are best stored in the fridge; bring a few to room temperature as needed to serve. Stored this way, cookies will last about 1 month. If your kitchen is generally cooler than 70°F, after chilling, cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Honey-Glazed Hasselback Butternut Squash With Parmesan Breadcrumbs Recipe,,"[Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg]
This butternut squash side dish is designed to steal the show. There's no shortage of flavor or texture here, from the thin, crispy ridges and the roasted garlic honey glaze to the sage leaves tucked inside and the salty-sweet topping of Parmesan cheese, panko breadcrumbs, dried cranberries, and pistachios.","Yield:Serves 8 as a side dish
Active time: 1 hour 30 minutes
Total time:2 hours
Rated: 3","Ingredients
1 medium head garlic
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 medium butternut squash (about 2 1/2–pounds; 1kg each)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup (2 ounces; 55g) unsalted butter
1 cup (12 ounces; 340g) honey
1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar
1 cup (1 3/4 ounces; 50g) panko breadcrumbs
1/2 cup (1 3/4 ounces; 50g) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/4 cup (1 ounce; 30g) dried cranberries, chopped, plus more for garnish
1/4 cup (1 ounce, 30 grams) chopped shelled pistachios, plus more for garnish
1 large bunch sage (about 30 leaves)","1.
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Slice off the top 1/4 inch of the head of garlic, exposing the tops of the cloves. Peel off any excess papery skin but leave the head intact. Drizzle the top of the exposed garlic with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and wrap in foil. Place on a large rimmed baking sheet and roast until softened, about 35 minutes.
2.
Meanwhile, peel the squash and cut in half lengthwise. Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, scoop out the seeds and discard. Rub the squash all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the squash, cut side down, to the same rimmed baking sheet as the garlic and roast until beginning to soften, about 15 minutes.
3.
As the squash roasts, prepare the glaze. In a small saucepan, combine butter, honey, and cider vinegar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low. When the garlic has finished roasting, squeeze the roasted cloves out of their skins into the glaze. Gently mash the garlic into the glaze with a wooden spoon. Continue to cook until the glaze is thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 5 more longer. Keep the glaze warm over very low heat until ready to use.
4.
Working one at a time, transfer a roasted squash half to a cutting board and place a wooden spoon on each side to act as stopping points for the knife. Carefully cut thin, vertical crosswise slits in the squash, each about 1/8 inch apart; none of the cuts should go fully through the squash. Carefully transfer the sliced squash half back to the baking sheet, scored side up, and repeat with the remaining butternut squash halves.
5.
Tuck the sage leaves in between some of the slits in the squash, using about 6 leaves per squash half. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, dried cranberries, and chopped pistachios. Brush the squash halves generously with all of the honey glaze, allowing some to drip down between the slits, and then top with the breadcrumb mixture.
6.
Roast until squash if soft enough to pierce with a fork and beginning to crisp on top, about 30 minutes. Garnish with additional cranberries, pistachios, and sage leaves, then serve.

","Carrots cut on the bias make slices large enough to grill easily—they become sweet and tender with a caramelized crust during a long roast over indirect heat. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
These carrots develop a natural sweetness as they're roasted on the grill. A finishing brush with a honey and soy sauce mixture leaves them with a glistening glaze that has a salty depth and a mild ginger and garlic bite.
Why this recipe works:
Cutting the carrots on the bias makes each slice larger and less likely to fall between the grates.
Roasting the carrots over indirect heat for 45 to 60 minutes renders them tender throughout and caramelized around the edges
Brushing the carrots with a honey and soy sauce mixture in the last minutes of cooking creates a glaze that enhances the sweetness and provides a salty contrast.","Yield:Serves 4
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 3.5","Ingredients
For the Glaze:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon freshly minced garlic, about 1 medium clove
1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
For the Carrots:
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch slices on a bias
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 scallion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt
Type of fire: two-zone indirect
Grill heat: medium-high","1.
For the Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper. Set aside.
2.
For the Carrots: Toss carrot slices with oil in a medium bowl. Season lightly with salt.
3.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place carrot slices on cool side of grill, close to, but not directly over, the coals. Cover and cook until tender all the way through, about 45 minutes, flipping carrots every 15 minutes for even browning.
4.
Brush carrots all over with glaze, cover grill, and continue to cook for 3 minutes longer.

Transfer carrots to serving bowl, drizzle with additional glaze, garnish with scallion, and serve immediately.

Cherry Coke-Glazed Country Ham Recipe,,"[Photograph: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
This ham is cooked low and slow and then coated in a sticky-sweet Cherry Coke glaze. For best results, get a good quality ham like Benton's.
Note: Before roasting your ham, you'll need to clean it and soak it. Rub it with a scrubby sponge under cool running water to remove any surface mold or salty deposits, then transfer it to a cooler and fill the cooler with cold water. Let the ham rest at room temperature in the water for at least a day, changing the water every six to eight hours. If your ham is especially well-aged, let it soak for up to two days. Country hams must be sliced very thin!","Yield:about 20

1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 250°F. Place ham fat-side up on rack set over roasting pan. Pour 2 cups water and 2 cups Coke into bottom of pan and seal tightly with aluminum foil (you may need 2 or 3 pieces).

2.
Meanwhile, combine remaining Coke, honey, brown sugar, black pepper, ground cloves, and cinnamon in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally until thick and syrupy, about 15 minutes.
3.
When ham has reached 125°F, remove from oven, uncover, and score fat cap in crosshatch pattern, making slices about 1-inch apart. Paint with 1/3 of glaze, increase oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake 5 minutes. Paint with 1/3 more glaze and bake until crisp and shiny, 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven and paint with remaining glaze. Tent with foil and allow to rest 30 minutes before slicing and serving.

A simple classic roast turkey that produces moist breast meat and juicy thighs. The key is to use a baking stone or Baking Steel to help the legs cook fast enough to catch up with the breast before it gets a chance to overcook, while par-cooking the stuffing ensures it reaches a safe temperature for consumption.
Note: For best results, dry-brine your turkey by following the instructions here. If dry-brining, omit any additional salt in herb butter.","Yield:10 to 12
Active time: 1 1/2 hours
Total time:6 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved, about 10 to 12 pounds
1 recipe classic sage and sauges stuffing or your favorite stuffing recipe, unbaked
12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter, divided
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh thyme leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried thyme)
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh rosemary leaves
2 medium garlic, minced or grated on microplane (about 2 teaspoons)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
3 stalks celery, roughly chopped
1 1/2 quarts homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon marmite
1/4 cup flour","1.
Set oven rack to lowest position and place a baking stone or Baking Steel on it. Preheat oven to 500°F. Allow to preheat for at least 45 minutes before adding turkey. Meanwhile, rinse turkey and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Set a V-rack into a rimmed baking sheet.
2.
Cut a double layered piece of cheesecloth into a rectangle about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. Line the interior cavity of the turkey with cheesecloth, leaving the ends hanging out the sides. Fill the cheesecloth-lined cavity until it is tightly packed and slightly overflowing with stuffing.Gather up ends of the cheesecloth and tie tightly with butcher's twine to seal.
3.
Carefully remove pouch of stuffing. Place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until the center reaches at least 180°F, about 10 minutes, checking every two to three minutes.
4.
Meanwhile, heat 8 tablespoons butter in small skillet or microwave until just melted (it should bubble). Transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk in parsley, thyme, sage, rosemary, garlic, and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Rub mixture evenly all over skin of bird (it should harden and clump a bit as it hits the cold bird).
5.
Using rubber gloves, clean kitchen towels or tongs, carefully return the hot bag of stuffing to the interior of the turkey. Cross the turkey's legs and tie tightly to seal. Stuff the cavity on the large side of the breasts underneath the flap of skin with more stuffing. Transfer any remaining stuffing to an appropriately sized baking dish (you should have a couple quarts left). Refrigerate extra dish of stuffing until ready to roast after turkey is cooked.
6.
Place turkey on a V-rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to baking stone. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Roast until golden brown and deepest part of breast registers 150°F on an instant read thermometer, stuffing registers at least 140°F, and legs register at least 165°F, 3 to 4 hours total, basting occasionally with browned butter from bottom of roasting pan.
7.
While turkey is roasting, chop neck into 1-inch chunks with cleaver. Heat oil in medium saucepan over high heat until smoking. Add turkey neck, onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, bay leaves, soy sauce, and marmite. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour then strain through fine mesh strainer. You should have a little over a quart of strained stock. If not, add water to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.
8.
After turkey is cooked, transfer V-rack back to clean rimmed baking sheet. Pour hot melted butter from bottom of pan over turkey. Tent with foil and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. Increase oven heat to 350°F and set a rack in the middle. Roast extra tray of stuffing while turkey rests. Meanwhile, set roasting pan over burner and add reserved stock. Scrape up browned bits with wooden spoon. Pour stock through fine mesh strainer set in 1 quart glass measure.
9.
Finely chop turkey gizzard and liver (if desired). Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan. Add chopped giblest and cook, stirring frequently, until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in thin steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
10.
Remove stuffing bag from turkey and untie. Carve turkey and serve with all of the stuffing and gravy.

","[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
It's hard to improve on an iconic holiday classic like slow-roasted prime rib, but this version really ups the ante on savory, beefy flavor, thanks to the addition of shio koji.
Shio koji is a funky, salty, and slightly sweet fermented Japanese marinade made with koji, the delicious mold that also gives us miso and soy sauce. Rich in protease enzymes, shio koji is able to season and tenderize large cuts, unlike other marinades that only achieve surface-level flavor. For this recipe, we use it in the same way that we would deploy salt for a dry-brined roast—spreading shio koji over the surface of the prime rib and letting it rest uncovered in the fridge overnight before cooking.
The salt in the shio koji seasons the roast, which is then cooked in a low oven using the reverse-sear method before getting a final blast of intense heat to produce a crisp, well-browned crust, thanks to the sugars in the marinade. Served with shio koji-spiked beef jus, this is the next chapter in the Serious Eats prime rib canon.","Yield:Serves 6 to 12, depending on size of roast

Freshly ground black pepper
For Serving:
Koji beef jus (optional)","1.
The Day Before Roasting, for the Prime Rib: Using a sharp knife, cut meat away from bone in one piece, cutting as close to the bone as possible, leaving you with a boneless roast and a slab of rib bones; reserve rib bones. Pat roast dry with paper towels; then using your hands, slather shio koji over entire surface of the roast and rib bones. Place roast back on bones, and, using butcher's twine, tie together so that roast looks as it did before meat was removed from the bones. Transfer roast, fat cap side up, to a wire rack set in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, then refrigerate, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.
2.
When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F (105°C). Using a paper towel, gently wipe away excess bits of shio koji from the fat cap side of the roast. Transfer baking sheet with rack and roast to oven and cook until internal temperature registers 125°F (52°C) on an instant-read thermometer at the roast's thickest point for medium-rare or 135°F (57°C) for medium, 4 to 5 hours.
3.
Remove roast from oven, tent loosely with foil, and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, increase oven temperature to 500°F (260°C) or highest possible temperature.

Ten minutes before guests are ready to be served, remove foil, place roast back in hot oven, and cook until deeply browned and crisp on the exterior, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and transfer roast to a carving board.
5.
For Serving: Cut away twine, and separate roast from ribs. Using a sharp knife, cut between ribs to separate into individual pieces, and then slice roast into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Serve right away, passing coarse sea salt and koji beef jus (if using) at the table.

","Do we really need a spread that's primarily cheese and mayonnaise? In the case of pimento cheese, the answer is yes. My Texan wife turned me onto this Southern classic, which is simply a mixture of grated sharp cheddar, mayo, pimentos, cayenne, and hot sauce. There are variations on this, but the most simple form is our favorite.
The pimentos go a long way in defining the flavor against the cheesy, creamy base. The cayenne and hot sauce add a little heat as a secondary bite after the sharpness of the cheddar.
It does not help my health that this is delicious on so many things—sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, crackers, and celery just to name a few—but it's hard to resist not eating it all the time whenever we have a batch sitting in the fridge.","Yield:Makes about 3 cups

"Roasted Sweet Potato Soup With Pistachio, Orange, and Mint Salsa Recipe",,"Flavored with a hint of orange, this sweet potato soup is rich and warming. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
This simple, warming soup is made with sweet roasted sweet potatoes and a splash of orange juice, and topped with a sauce made from crushed pistachios, olive oil, mint, scallions, and orange zest.
Why this recipe works:
Roasting the sweet potatoes first at a low temperature enhances their sweetness, then a few minutes at a higher temperature browns them gently.
A splash of fresh orange juice and zest adds depth and fragrance without being cloying.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 30 minutes

For the Pesto:
1 tightly packed cup basil leaves (1 1/4 ounces; 35g)
1 tightly packed cup arugula (1 1/4 ounces; 35g)
1 medium clove garlic
2 tablespoons blanched almonds (3/4 ounce; 20g)
1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh lemon juice, from about half a lemon
1 teaspoon lemon zest, from about half a lemon
1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil

White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
With a blend of butter and melted white chocolate creamed with toasted sugar, these cookies bake up thick and rich, but none too sweet. They're chock-full of dry-roasted macadamia nuts and chunks of real white chocolate, for a nutty vanilla cookie that's more than meets the eye.","Yield:Makes about 30 (3-inch) cookies
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:About 45 minutes
Rated: 4.9","Ingredients
4 ounces white chocolate, minimum 30% cocoa butter (about 1/2 cup, roughly chopped; 115g), from brands such as Green & Black's (see note)
8 3/4 ounces plain or lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/4 cups; 250g)
1 3/4 teaspoons (7g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), soft but cool, about 60°F (16°C)
1 large egg (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g), straight from the fridge
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
8 ounces salted, dry-roasted macadamia nuts, roughly chopped (about 1 2/3 cups; 225g), from brands such as MacFarms, plus more for garnishing
5 ounces roughly chopped white chocolate, minimum 30% cocoa butter (about 3/4 cup; 140g), from brands such as Green & Black's, plus more for garnishing","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate using three or four 15-second bursts at normal power; to prevent scorching, pause to stir the white chocolate between rounds. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, then add sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and butter. Cream mixture on medium speed until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes, pausing at the halfway mark to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
2.
Resume mixing on medium speed. With mixer still running, add egg, followed by vanilla, and continue beating just until well combined. Pause to scrape bowl and beater with flexible spatula, then resume mixing on low. Add flour all at once; when flour is fully incorporated, use flexible spatula to fold in the macadamia nuts and the remainder of the white chocolate.
3.
Using a cookie scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. If you like, these can be transferred to a zipper-lock bag and refrigerated for up to 1 week, or frozen for up to 3 months; soften to about 68°F (20°C) before baking.
4.
Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half-sheet pan, leaving about 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Gently flatten each portion into a disk, then top each with a few extra pieces of white chocolate and macadamia nuts and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake until puffed and firm around the edges, though rather pale overall, about 12 minutes. (Due to their low lactose content, these cookies will not brown as you might expect. When fully baked, they will still be quite pale.) Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.

Creamy Scrambled Eggs with Caviar Recipe,,"Last night I went through 72 eggs worth of scrambled eggs doing some recipe research. Of course, the great thing about developing recipes for a living is that when the clock strikes 2 a.m. and you realize you haven't eaten all night, the solution is usually right in front of you. But what to pair with that final batch of ultra-rich and creamy eggs?
Most people don't think caviar when searching for a midnight snack, but why not? Caviar doesn't need to be expensive—you can get small jars of American lumpfish or paddlefish caviar for just a few bucks at most gourmet grocery stores, and with caviar, a little goes a long way. Sure, it won't have the complexity or the tender, bursting texture of the premium stuff, but that doesn't mean it can't serve its purpose. My wife and I happened to have a few jars of the pasteurized stuff kicking around the fridge from a recent trip to Sweden. The tiny eggs are a little tough from the sterilization process, but they taste just fine and last pretty much forever.
To finish off my snack, all I had to do was toast a slice of bread, pile the creamy eggs on top, spoon a bit of caviar over it, and garnish it with a bit of chopped red onions and sour cream. Eggs on eggs. Chicken of the Sea. Whatever you want to call it, I call it simply delicious.
Note: There's no need to get really expensive caviar for this simple dish. Cheap American paddlefish or lumpfish roe works just fine, as does salmon roe or tobikko. I used white bread, but pumpernickel or black bread would be appropriate as well. If you want to get extra fancy, replace the toast with blini or potato pancakes.","Yield:serves 4
Active time: 5 minutes
Total time:5 minutes","Ingredients
4 eggs
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon heavy cream
1-2 ounces caviar (see note)
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup finely chopped red onions or shallots
2-3 slices toast (see note)","1.
Whisk together eggs and salt in medium bowl. Melt butter in 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and cook, stirring continuously until they begin to set around the edges, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook, gently stirring and scraping constantly until eggs are thick enough that the spatula leaves a trail in the bottom, about 1 minute longer. Continue to cook, stirring more vigorously to prevent eggs from forming large curds until eggs are just barely set and no liquid remains. Add heavy cream, stir to combine, and transfer eggs to serving plate.

Serve eggs immediately with toast, passing caviar, sour cream, and red onions at the table.

Apple and Pear Tarte Tatin Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
This is the perfect tart for showcasing the colors and flavors of the fall season. The fruit caramelizes in a simple syrup of butter, sugar, and apple cider, making the apples and pears fork-tender over layers of flaky puff pastry.
Note: For the puff pastry, you may choose to make your own dough, or purchase it from your grocer's freezer. If using frozen dough, be sure to defrost it for three hours in the fridge before using.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 1 hour (not including time for puff pastry)
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 2","Ingredients
14 ounces (about 1 package) puff pastry dough, cold (see note)
Flour, for dusting
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (about 4 ounces) granulated sugar
30 ounces peeled and cored apples and or pears, cut in half down the axis (about 10 medium)
6 tablespoons apple cider
1 pinch of salt","1.
On a bench dusted with flour, roll out the puff pastry until it is just shy of 1/4 inch thick and completely covers the circumference of the 12-inch skillet that you will use for baking the tart tatin, ensuring that there is at least 1 inch of overhang all around the edge of the pan. Place the sheet of puff pastry on a parchment lined sheet tray in the fridge to relax for 30 minutes or more.
2.
Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the frying pan over medium heat. Melt the butter in the pan, tilting it to evenly coat the bottom. Sprinkle the sugar over the butter and tilt the pan to evenly disperse the sugar. When the sugar just begins to melt and brown slightly, place the fruit in the pan. Saute the fruit on each side for two minutes, taking care not to dent the fruit on the round side that will face up in the final tart. The fruit should only be slightly cooked. Add the cider to deglaze the pan and position the fruit around the pan, packed tightly together, with the cut side facing up. Remove the pan from heat. Cover the top of the apples with the chilled pastry and tuck all of the overhanging dough down along the inside of the pan, so it creates a crust around the apples. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20 minutes at 400°F, then reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake until the crust is a deep golden brown and very firm to the touch with the juices bubbling vigorously beneath the crust, about 20 minutes longer. Remove the tart from the oven and allow it to sit for one minute.
3.
Using oven mitts or kitchen towels, place an inverted plate of greater size than the pan over the top of the tart. Grasp the plate and hold it firmly against the pan. Working swiftly, invert the pan so that the plate is on the bottom and the tart is flipped with the fruit on top. Remove the pan and take caution, the juices from the fruit will be very hot. Allow them to drip out of the pan and onto the tart. Allow the tart to cool for 10 minutes before serving warm, or place in the oven for 5 minutes before serving.

Homemade Swiss Miss With Mini Marshmallows Recipe,,"[Photographs: Ryan Jones]
Look, this isn't fancy drinking chocolate, liquid chocolate, or even hot chocolate. This is cocoa. Hot cocoa. It's light enough and not too sweet, making it highly drinkable even with a rich holiday breakfast. Best enjoyed with one to five hundred mini marshmallows, crispy or otherwise.
Even if you hate white chocolate, don't leave it out. It doesn't impart its signature flavor, but rather contributes to the body and sweetness of the recipe. Likewise, the small amount of coffee powder doesn't make this mocha, but rounds out the chocolate flavor in a subtle but important way. For both the white and dark chocolate, use bars of chocolate rather than chips. Chips contain various additives to help retain their shape while baking and make for a weakly flavored, poorly textured cocoa.
This cocoa mix keeps for months, stored in a jar. Make a double batch for gift giving or just to get you through the winter.
Note: All measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a scale for all pastry projects. Serious Eats' recommended kitchen scale is the Oxo Good Grips Scale with Pull Out Display.","Yield:10 mugs of cocoa
Rated: 5","Ingredients
5 ounces powdered sugar
2 3/4 ounces white chocolate, broken into pieces
1 1/2 ounces cocoa powder
1 1/4 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces
Pinch of salt
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
1/2 teaspoon instant coffee
Marshmallows, crispy or traditional.","1.
Make the cocoa mix:
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, white chocolate, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, salt, vanilla bean seeds and instant coffee. Pulse until the mixture is finely ground. If the processor starts to get warm, take a break for a minute to let it cool. Continue pulsing until no large bits of chocolate remain. (Don't run the processor continuously, as this will cause the machine to warm and will start to melt the chocolate a bit, creating a weird clumpy mixture.)
Transfer the ground cocoa mix to an airtight container. The mixture will store indefinitely at room temperature.
2.
To prepare the cocoa:
Whisk 3 tablespoons (about one ounce) of cocoa mix into 6 ounces of boiling milk. Adjust with more cocoa to taste. Add marshmallows.
If you're serving a crowd and want to prepare all of the cocoa at once, start by bringing a half gallon of milk (along with the reserved vanilla pod, if you like) to a boil in a pot over medium high heat. Turn the heat to medium and whisk in all of the cocoa, a half cup at a time. Whisk continuously until all of the mixture has dissolved.
Serve immediately, or transfer to a thermos.

Chocolate Cherry Layer Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph and video: Vicky Wasik]
If you love chocolate-covered cherries, this festive layer cake is just for you. With tart cherry juice in the batter and freeze-dried cherries in the whipped cream frosting, it's a bright and fruity twist on an otherwise classic chocolate cake. The flavor of the cake itself depends on rich, full-fat cocoa powder, whether natural or Dutch-process. I recommend either Callebaut or Sunfood Cacao for natural, and Valrhona or Cacao Barry Extra Brute for Dutch. These options all boast about twice the cocoa content of supermarket brands, ensuring a moist and flavorful cake.

Sift flour and cocoa together to combine. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine sugar, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, almond extract, and eggs. Whip on medium-high until foamy and light, about 5 minutes, then drizzle in oil. Reduce speed to low and add tart cherry juice, followed by sifted flour/cocoa mixture. When mixture is well combined, divide between prepared cake pans, adding about 17 3/4 ounces (505g) to each. Bake until puffed and firm, about 22 minutes; a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake will leave a few crumbs attached. Cool cakes in their pans until no trace of warmth remains, about 45 minutes.
2.
For the Cherry Whipped Cream: In the bowl of a food processor, grind freeze-dried fruit and sugar until powdery and fine, about 90 seconds. Add cream and almond extract (if using), and stir with a fork to ensure no dry pockets of sugar/fruit are stuck in the corners, then pulse until thick and creamy like Greek yogurt, about 5 minutes. The time will vary with the horsepower of your machine, so watch it like a hawk to avoid making fruity butter by mistake. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed.
3.
To Assemble the Cake: Using a serrated bread knife, trim the dome from each cake so that the layers stack neatly and can absorb moisture from the cream. Place 1 cake (cut side up) on a serving plate, cake stand, or cast iron turntable. Top with 1 cup cherry whipped cream and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Place second cake (cut side down) on top. Smooth cream around sides, then wipe spatula clean. Spread another cup of cherry whipped cream in an even layer on top of cake, then use remaining whipped cream to generously cover sides and decorate by swirling cream with the back of a spoon. If you like, sprinkle with freeze-dried cherries just before serving.
4.
Under a cake dome or loosely wrapped in plastic, the cake will keep up to 24 hours at room temperature. Alternatively, the cake can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated up to 3 days, then brought to room temperature to serve.

1 small butternut squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), split lengthwise, seeds removed
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 thyme sprigs
2 cloves garlic
1 medium onion, finely sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)
1 1/2 quarts fresh carrot juice (see note)
1/4 cup chopped parsley (optional)
1/4 cup toasted pumpkin or squash seeds (optional)","1.

Chicken Liver Pâté With Bourbon and Cranberry Gelée Recipe,,"All-American ingredients like bourbon, apple cider, and cranberries are the stars of this holiday pâté. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Designed for the Thanksgiving table, this chicken liver pâté is flavored with bourbon and apple cider, then topped with a cranberry gelée. It's silky, smooth, and perfect for a holiday gathering.
Why This Recipe Works:
Removing the livers from the skillet before deglazing with bourbon reduces the chances of overcooking them, which helps guarantee pâté with a silky texture.
Passing the pâté through a fine mesh strainer produces an especially refined texture.
Note: You can use sweetened cranberry juice, but if you do, omit the sugar.","Yield:Makes 1 terrine
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:5 hours","Ingredients
2 pounds chicken livers, trimmed of sinew and fat
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 shallots, minced
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
2 ounces bourbon or American whiskey
2 ounces apple cider
1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter
1/2 envelope unflavored gelatin
1 cup unsweetened cranberry juice (see note)
2 tablespoons sugar","1.
Pat livers dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet until smoking. Cook half of the livers, turning, until browned on both sides and pink in the middle, about 4 minutes. Transfer livers to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1 more tablespoon oil, heat until smoking and repeat with remaining livers.
2.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet, add shallots and thyme and cook, stirring until softened, about 2 minutes. Add bourbon and cook, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet, until almost evaporated (you can flame the bourbon, but use caution as flames can leap high from the skillet). Add cider and cook until slightly reduced. Scrape shallots and any remaining liquid into food-processor bowl with livers.
3.
Add butter and process, stopping to scrape down sides, until a smooth puree forms.
4.
Set a fine mesh strainer over a large mixing bowl and, using a wooden spoon or ladle, press and plunge liver puree through it. Season liver puree with salt and pepper and scrape into a large ramekin or terrine, tapping against counter to remove air pockets. Smooth surface, then press plastic wrap directly against surface and chill in refrigerator until set, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
5.
In a glass measuring cup, sprinkle gelatin on top of cranberry juice and let stand for 15 minutes.
6.
Transfer cranberry juice and gelatin to a small saucepan and stir in sugar. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved and juice is simmering. Remove from heat and let cool.
7.
Gently pour cooled cranberry juice on top. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until cranberry juice sets, at least 2 hours. Pâté can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before serving.

"Endive, Shallot, and Goat Cheese Tart Recipe",,"Endives lose their trademark bitterness when roasted, making the perfect fall filling for a pastry crust. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
If you only know endive as a crunchy, leafy, bitter green, then you've been missing out. Roasted, grilled, or sautéed, the wide-leafed vegetable loses much of its trademark bitterness, allowing its sweet, faintly earthy character to emerge at full force. Here, it's combined with shallots and goat cheese for a rich, buttery quiche-like tart.
Why this recipe works:
Blind-baking the crust keeps it flaky and prevents sogginess
The addition of anchovies adds an umami depth that's hard to replicate with other ingredients.","Yield:Serves 6-8 as a side dish
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 10 minutes","Ingredients
1/2 recipe easy pie dough or pre-made uncooked pie crust
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/3 cup finely sliced shallots or vidalia onion (3 to 4 medium shallots)
4 to 5 endives, hearts removed, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices (7 cups)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 medium cloves minced garlic (about 2 teaspoons)
5 oil-packed anchovies
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
Pinch red pepper flakes
2 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup heavy cream
6 ounces fresh or semi-fresh goat cheese (such as Bucheron de Chevre) in 1/4-inch slices","1.
Adjust oven rack to bottom position and preheat oven to 425°F. Lay rolled out pie dough into a tart or pie pan, pressing gently into the edges. With a docker or the tines of a fork, poke holes in even rows across the base of the crust. Measure out a piece of parchment paper to fit the pan. Line the dough with the parchment paper and fill the pan with pie weights, dried beans, or dry rice.
2.
Place the pan into the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Remove pie weights and parchment paper, wrap edges of the pie dough with tin foil, and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Remove and allow to come to room temperature.
3.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and endive, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, balsamic vinegar, anchovies, and a pinch of chili flakes. Continue cooking until the shallots are translucent and the endive has fully softened, about 10 minutes longer. remove from heat and transfer mixture to a strainer set over a large bowl over the sink. Allow to drain and cool for 10 minutes.
4.
In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with cream and Parmesan cheese until fully combined. Add endive-shallot mixture to the bowl and stir until evenly combined. Pour mixture into the tart pan and cover the surface with slices of goat cheese.
5.
Return the tart to the oven and bake 20 minutes. Cover tart with tin foil and continue baking for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and rest 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

Apple-Ginger Tishpishti (Gluten-Free Almond and Walnut Cake) Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Tishpishti is a traditional Sephardic cake, in the spirit of nutty, sweet, syrupy North African and Middle Eastern desserts like baklava. Though it's commonly served at Passover, when flour and leavening action are forbidden, I like it any time I need a gluten-free dessert. This is my Americanized version: a heady mix of spices and citrus, with grated apple added to the traditional nut-based cake. Rather than rose blossom syrup, I opt for a ginger-infused syrup that's boozy with Applejack, America’s own apple brandy.","Yield:Serves 12
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:3 hours","Ingredients
For the Syrup:
1 cup sugar (7 ounces; 200g)
1 1/2 cups unsweetened apple juice (12 ounces; 340g)
2-inch piece ginger (2 ounces; 60g), unpeeled, cut in half lengthwise and smashed
Zest from 1 medium lemon
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (1/2 ounce; 14g), from about 1 lemon
4 tablespoons Applejack brandy (2 ounces; 60g)
For the Cake:
4 large eggs (6.8 ounces; 190g)
3/4 cup sugar (5 3/4 ounces; 160g)
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same by weight
1 cup vegetable oil (8 ounces; 220g), or any other neutral oil
2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger (1 ounce; 30g)
2 1/2 cups almond flour (8 ounces; 230g)
1 1/2 cups finely chopped walnuts (6.2 ounces; 175g)
2 teaspoons (6g) ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2 cups grated unpeeled Fuji apple (12 ounces; 340g), from about 2 medium apples","1.
Getting Ready: Adjust rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 9- by 13-inch anodized aluminum baking pan with parchment paper, covering bottom and long sides of pan. (It's all right to leave the short sides exposed.) Lightly grease pan with nonstick cooking spray.
2.
For the Syrup: In a 2-quart nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat, simmer together sugar, apple juice, ginger, and lemon peel until syrup reaches 234°F (112°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Remove syrup from heat and add lemon juice and Applejack. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.
3.
For the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine eggs, sugar, and salt. Using a whisk attachment, whip on high until eggs become thick, pale, and ribbon-y, about 10 minutes. With mixer running on medium, slowly drizzle in oil in a thin stream until fully incorporated and thick. Whisk in grated ginger, about 10 seconds, then shut off mixer and remove bowl.
4.
Using a flexible rubber spatula, fold in almond flour, walnuts, cinnamon, and nutmeg until combined. Fold in grated apple. Pour batter into prepared pan and gently tap on the counter to evenly distribute. Bake until golden brown and top of cake bounces back to the touch, about 50 minutes.
5.
While cake is still warm, loosen exposed short sides of cake from pan using an offset spatula or butter knife. Using parchment paper as a handle, lift cake out of pan and onto a cutting board. Cut cake into diamond shapes by making a series of diagonal slices in one direction across the cake, then making another series of diagonal slices in the opposite direction. Lift sliced cake, again using parchment, and return to pan. Strain syrup over warm cake using a fine-mesh strainer, then let sit at least 1 hour to allow cake to fully absorb syrup. Serve.

Total time:1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes","Ingredients
4 (12-ounce; 340g) potatoes, preferably russets
Canola, vegetable, or olive oil, for rubbing
1/3 cup sour cream (80ml), plus more for topping, if desired
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup refried beans
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 cups cheese sauce
1 cup pico de gallo
1/2 ripe Hass avocado, halved, pitted, flesh scooped from skin, and cubed","1.
If Using Only the Oven (see note): Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Rub each potato with a light coating of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 1 hour. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.
2.
If Using the Microwave and Oven (see note): Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Using a fork or paring knife, puncture potatoes in several spots. Microwave potatoes for 5 minutes. Rub each potato with a light coat of oil. Arrange on a rack set on a baking sheet, or directly on an oven rack, and bake until a fork can easily be inserted into the center of each potato, about 20 minutes. If setting potatoes directly on oven rack, set a sheet of foil on the rack below to catch any oil drips.

Raspberry-Almond Rugelach Recipe,,"[Photograph: Emily Dryden]
A whisper of orange zest in the dough zings in contrast with the jammy filling studded with nuts. You can substitute any jam, nut, or citrus here—this recipe is like a roadmap to rugelach. Start with rich, flaky cream cheese dough; add the citrus zest; and wrap it around the filling. This is less about the spices and more about the jam, so select a good spread, and be stingy while spreading it. Just a scant half cup will do the trick.","Yield:Makes 12 or 16 cookies, depending on form
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:3 hours","Ingredients
For the Dough:
4 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 118g), plus more for dusting
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), cut into large cubes
4 ounces cold cream cheese (8 tablespoons; 115g), cut into large cubes
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
For the Filling and to Finish:
1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) almonds, toasted and finely chopped
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup raspberry jam, homemade or a good-quality store-bought brand, such as Bonne Maman
1 egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon (5ml) cool water
1 teaspoon sparkling sugar","1.
For the Dough: In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, butter, cream cheese, orange zest, and salt. Pulse 4 to 5 times, then turn the processor on and process until the dough forms a shaggy ball, about 1 minute.
2.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured sheet of plastic wrap and lightly flour your hands. If making crescent cookies, gently form a disk 5 inches in diameter. If making sliced cookies, form dough into a 3- by 4-inch rectangle. Dust surface with flour and wrap tightly. Lightly press with a rolling pin to smooth, then lightly tap the disk or rectangle's edges on the counter. The smoother the edges, the less prone they will be to cracking later on. Chill until the dough registers 40°F (4°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour. The dough may be frozen for 3 months; defrost overnight in the refrigerator to proceed.
3.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Stack 2 baking sheets and line the top one with parchment paper.
4.
For the Filling: In a small bowl, combine almonds and sugar.
5.
For Crescent-Style Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 9-inch circle, using a dinner plate and paring knife to trim edges. Spread jam over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle almond mixture evenly over jam, then top with bread crumbs. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut disk into 16 equal wedges. Starting from the wide end of each long triangle, roll up and press on the pointy end to seal. Place seam side down on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining triangles, working quickly and placing cookies about 2 inches apart. Transfer baking sheet to the freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
6.
For Sliced Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 4- by 12-inch rectangle. Spread jam over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the two 12-inch edges. Sprinkle almond mixture evenly over jam, then top with bread crumbs. Starting at one 12-inch edge, tightly roll dough into a spiral. Aim to make 3 full revolutions, pressing seam firmly to seal. Place roll on baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate for at least 30 and no more than 45 minutes. (If chilled for longer, allow dough to warm very slightly at room temperature, so it will not crack when sliced.) Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut roll into 12 cookies, each the shape of an isosceles trapezoid. Keep the smaller edge of the trapezoid no less than 1/2 inch in length, and the larger edge no more than 1 1/2 inches in length. Place seam side down on baking sheet and transfer to freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
7.
To Finish and Bake: Brush cookies' surface with egg wash using a small pastry brush. Sprinkle with sparkling sugar. Bake cookies until browned and flaky, about 22 to 25 minutes. Some filling may squish out; that’s okay. The bottoms of the rugelach should be caramelized, not blackened. Transfer the cookies (still on the parchment) to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Store in an airtight container, layered between sheets of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month.

Pork Schnitzel Meatballs Recipe,,"Photographs: Marvin Gapultos
For this meatball version of pork schnitzel, a simple blend of thyme, lemon zest, and parsley is combined with ground pork; the mixture is then formed into balls, rolled in flour, egg, and panko and then deep-fried until crisp. The crunchy panko shell gives way to a juicy schnitzel interior—just like its cutlet counterpart. And also like its cutlet counterpart, these meatballs need no further embellishment other than a squeeze of lemon, but a bit of sauerkraut or a dip in grainy mustard work wonderfully well too.","Yield:Makes 18 to 20 meatballs

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/2 cup flour
1 egg, beaten
1 quart vegetable, canola, or peanut oil.","1.
In a large bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of Panko with the milk and set aside to soak for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the ground pork, thyme, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, pepper, and parsley and gently mix until thoroughly incorporated.

Working with wet hands, use a tablespoon measure to scoop out meat mixture and roll between your palms to form a meatball about an inch in diameter. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet or large plate and repeat until all the mixture is used.
3.
Place the flour, egg, and remaining cup of Panko into three separate medium bowls or shallow dishes. Dredge each meatball in the flour, then in the egg, and finally in the panko. Replace the breaded meatballs on the rimmed baking sheet or plate.
4.
Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet, Dutch oven, or wok until it reaches 350°F on a deep-fry thermometer. Adjust flame to maintain temperature. Working in batches, fry the meatballs, turning frequently, until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes total. Transfer the meatballs to a large platter lined with paper towels and season with salt. Serve the meatballs with lemon wedges, or with grainy stone-ground mustard.

","A tender and moist braised beef brisket in an apricot and cranberry sauce. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
A beef roast worthy of a holiday centerpiece, this flavorful and moist brisket point is simmered in a barbecue-inspired sauce that's given a seasonal touch by way of apricots and cranberries.
Why this recipe works:
The brisket point has more fat than the flat, which gives it a meatier flavor and added moisture.
Searing the brisket further enhances the beefiness of the dish.
A barbecue-influenced tomato-based sauce gets an appropriate fruity holiday touch with the addition of dried apricots and cranberries, plus apricot preserves and cranberry sauce.
Chilling the brisket after cooking makes for easier slicing and a more tender and flavorful end result.
Note: The brisket can be sliced and served after finished cooking in step 3, but for best results, cool and reheat.","Yield:serves 6 to 8

","Romesco sauce and grilled leeks are a natural pair. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
Cooking leeks on the grill can take a very long time, but by par-boiling them first, we were able to cut the grilling time to less than 10 minutes. Once softened and lightly charred, they make a beautiful pairing with Spanish romesco sauce, made from almonds and roasted tomatoes and peppers.
Why this recipe works:
Softening the leeks in boiling water prior to grilling cuts down cooking time.
Searing the leeks over direct fire gives them a light char with a distinct grilled flavor.
The slightly sweet and creamy Romesco sauce is a great complement to the sweet and oniony leeks.","Yield:serves 4
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:45 minutes","Ingredients
Kosher salt
4 large leeks, dark green tops discarded, leeks split in half, and thoroughly washed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
1 recipe Romesco Sauce
Type of fire: Direct
Grill heat: medium-high","1.
Prepare a large bowl of iced water and bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil leeks until they start to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer leeks to ice water and let stand until cool. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and pat dry.
2.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over the charcoal grate. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Brush leeks lightly with oil and grill over direct heat until they start to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Flip over and continue to grill until second side browns, about 3 to 5 minutes longer. Transfer leeks to a platter, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately with Romesco sauce.

Vegan Chocolate-Covered Digestive Biscuits Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Like graham crackers, digestive biscuits get their distinctive flavor and tenderness from a portion of whole wheat flour worked into the dough. Their crunchy texture and grainy flavor are perfectly offset by a thick layer of your favorite vegan chocolate.","Yield:Makes 16 (2 3/4–inch) cookies
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 1/2 hours","Ingredients
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)
2 ounces whole wheat flour (about 1/3 cup; 55g), plus more for dusting
2 1/4 ounces quick-toasted sugar (about 1/3 cup; 60g)
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon (0.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or use the same weight
4 ounces refined coconut oil (about 2/3 cup; 113g), solid and cool
3/4 ounce water (about 5 1/4 teaspoons; 20g)
9 ounces roughly chopped vegan chocolate (about 1 1/2 cups; 285g) (see note)","1.
Make the Dough: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (177°C). Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, toasted sugar, cream of tartar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and solid coconut oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until oil virtually disappears into a fine, floury meal. Add water and pulse to form a damp and crumbly dough. Turn onto an unfloured surface and knead into a ball.
2.
Roll and Bake the Biscuits: On a generously floured surface, roll dough until just shy of 1/4 inch (4.7mm), using as much flour as needed along the way to prevent sticking. Dust away excess flour with a pastry brush and decorate with a docking tool if you like. Cut into 2 3/4–inch rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Gather up scraps, knead, roll, and cut as before.
3.
Bake until firm and dry to the touch but quite pale, about 22 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pan and continue with next step, or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.
4.
Temper the Chocolate: Temper chocolate according to one of the methods described here.
5.
Coat the Biscuits: Working with just 2 or 3 biscuits at a time, dollop a generous 1/2 tablespoon, or just over 1/4 ounce, chocolate over each. Spread into an even layer over biscuit and, as chocolate starts to thicken, bounce the tines of a fork across the surface to create a wavy pattern. Repeat with remaining biscuits and chocolate. (Before it hardens, store excess chocolate according to the directions here.) Serve biscuits immediately, preferably with hot tea, and transfer to an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature.

Crumble bacon and sprinkle all over.
9.
Top with scallions and serve with chips and celery. The dip can be served hot, warm, or at room temperature. It can be assembled in advance (leaving blue cheese, bacon, and scallions off until the very end) and reheated in the oven before serving.

Oysters Rockefeller Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Oysters Rockefeller is a decadent New Orleans classic that is often imitated but rarely duplicated—because the original recipe is a carefully guarded secret. This version ditches the spinach found in most attempts at recreating the dish (despite there being no evidence to support its inclusion) and brightens things up with fresh herbs.","Yield:Makes 24 oysters
Active time: 35 minutes
Total time:45 minutes","Ingredients
8 tablespoons (4 ounces; 115g) unsalted butter, softened and divided
2 large shallots (4 ounces; 115g), thinly sliced
2 celery ribs (3 1/2 ounces; 100g), thinly sliced, plus 1/4 cup (1/4 ounce; 6g) celery leaves, divided
1/2 fennel bulb (3 1/2 ounces; 100g), cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved
4 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
3 scallions (2 ounces; 60g), white and green parts divided and thinly sliced

1 tablespoon (15ml) absinthe (optional, see note)
3 cups (1 1/2 ounces; 40g) fresh parsley leaves
1/2 cup (1 ounce; 30g) panko bread crumbs
Rock (ice cream) salt (see note)
24 fresh oysters, scrubbed
Lemon wedges, for serving","1.
In a medium (3-quart) saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat until foaming. Add shallots, sliced celery ribs, fennel bulb, garlic, scallion whites, and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, have released all their liquid, and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in absinthe. Transfer mixture to food processor bowl.
2.
Process vegetables, scraping down sides of food processor bowl as needed, into a coarse paste, about 30 seconds. Stop processor and add parsley, celery leaves, fennel fronds, and scallion greens to food processor bowl. Continue processing until herbs are broken down and well-combined with vegetable mixture, about 30 seconds. With food processor still running, gradually add remaining 4 tablespoons butter, making sure butter is emulsified into paste before adding more. Stop processor and add panko bread crumbs. Pulse mixture until bread crumbs are fully incorporated. Season to taste with salt, erring on the side of less salt, since the oysters are briny. Transfer mixture to disposable pastry bag or small mixing bowl, and set aside. If using a mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap, pressing plastic against surface of the paste to prevent skin from forming. If not serving immediately, mixture can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 day; let sit at room temperature to soften before using, about 30 minutes.
3.
Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below the broiler element and preheat the broiler on high. Line rimmed baking sheet with an even 1/2-inch layer of rock salt. Shuck oysters and arrange them on prepared baking sheet. Pipe or spoon butter topping over oysters, and then use an offset spatula or butter knife to smooth topping and fully cover each oyster.

3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (6 ounces; 170g), divided
4 pounds Roma (plum) tomatoes (1.8kg; about 18 medium)
4 to 6 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
8 to 10 sprigs fresh thyme
1/4 cup capers (2 ounces; 60g), drained
1 teaspoon dried basil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
Getting Started: Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set 2 wire cooling racks into the sheets. Brush wire racks with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. Adjust 2 oven racks to the upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 250°F (120°C). Fill a large stockpot with water and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and water to make an ice bath.
2.
To Blanch the Tomatoes: Using a small paring or tourné knife, remove the core from the stem end of each tomato. On the opposite end, carve a small x through the skin of each tomato. Working with small batches of 4 to 5 at a time, drop tomatoes into the boiling water and blanch until you see the skin pulling away from the flesh in the area where each tomato is scored, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer tomatoes to ice bath to halt the cooking and continue until all the tomatoes are blanched.
3.
Using a small paring knife, tourné knife, or your hands, peel tomatoes. Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise and arrange them, cut side up, on oiled wire racks. Brush cut sides of tomatoes with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Place a slice of garlic on each tomato half. Scatter sprigs of thyme across tomatoes.
4.
Place trays of tomatoes in the oven and bake until each tomato half has reduced to a quarter of its size. They should remain more plump than sun-dried tomatoes, still jammy in the center. Depending on the air circulation in your oven and how juicy the tomatoes are to start, this can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. The total weight of the tomatoes after cooking will drop from 4 pounds (1.8kg) to about 14 ounces (400g).
5.
To Make the Spread: Discard garlic and thyme from roasted tomatoes. In a food processor, pulse together roasted tomatoes, capers, and dried basil. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup olive oil and season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Serve with bread, tossed with pasta or vegetables, or alongside grilled meats. The spread will keep in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for 6 months.

Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip Recipe,,"[Photographs: Kristin Donnelly]
This vegan version of a classic spinach and artichoke dip harnesses the power of cauliflower and cashews to create a rich, thick, and creamy base for the vegetables. Nutritional yeast, mustard, lemon juice, and garlic in two forms come together to pull off the tangy, savory flavors of sour cream and cheese.","Yield:Makes 4 cups
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 hour
Rated: 3.5","Ingredients
1 cup (235ml) homemade vegetable stock or low-sodium vegetable broth
1 pound (450g) cauliflower, cored and cut into medium florets (12 ounces/340g after prep)
2 ounces raw cashews (55g; 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup (60ml) homemade or store-bought vegan mayonnaise
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon (15ml) Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons garlic powder
Kosher salt
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 (10-ounce/285g) box frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed of excess liquid, or 12 ounces fresh spinach, trimmed or 10 ounces (340g) fresh baby spinach
1 (14-ounce/395g) can artichokes, artichokes drained and halved
Freshly ground black pepper
Tortilla chips or pita chips, for serving","1.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). In a large deep skillet, bring vegetable stock to a simmer over medium heat. Add cashews and cauliflower and stir to coat, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cover and cook until the cauliflower is very tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. (If the broth seems to be steaming from the lid, reduce the heat to low. You want to cook the cauliflower while retaining as much of the liquid as possible.)
2.
Transfer the cauliflower, cashews, and liquid to a food processor and let cool for 1 minute. Purée until very smooth. (You need to keep the machine running for a minute or more, scraping down the sides periodically, to get a super smooth purée.)
3.
Add mayonnaise, nutritional yeast, mustard, lemon juice, garlic powder, and process until incorporated. Season with salt.
4.
Wipe out the skillet. Add olive oil and heat over medium heat until warmed. Add minced garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant and softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spinach, a large pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until wilted, if fresh, or heated through, if frozen. Transfer spinach to a fine-mesh strainer and press or squeeze to drain any excess liquid.
5.
Add cooked spinach and artichokes to the food processor and pulse a few times, just until incorporated. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
6.
Scrape the dip into a 1-quart baking dish and bake for about 30 minutes, until just starting to brown around the edges. To brown the top, turn on the broiler and arrange the pan within 4 inches of the heat. Broil until the dip is browned to your liking, 2 to 3 minutes. (If you’re in a rush, you can skip the baking step and just serve the dip while it’s warm or room temperature, right from the food processor. Alternatively, you can make the dip a day ahead and bake it the following day. Just add 10 minutes to the cooking time.)
7.
Serve hot with chips.

Everything-Bagel Rugelach With Onion Jam Recipe,,"[Photograph: Emily Dryden]
Who says rugelach have to be sweet? The dough easily switches teams when introduced to this savory onion jam—sultry and sticky and rich. The onion jam cooks low and slow until the rough, sweet, tangy flavors mellow. (My jam recipe makes more than what's needed for the cookies, and that's a good thing.) Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with everything-bagel seasoning—that delightful mixture of poppy, caraway, and sesame seeds; dehydrated onion and garlic; and salt—for the ideal accessory for a cheese platter or a delicious snack with a cocktail.","Yield:Makes 12 or 16 cookies, depending on form
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:3 hours","Ingredients
For the Dough:
4 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 118g), plus more for dusting
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), cut into large cubes
4 ounces cold cream cheese (8 tablespoons; 115g), cut into large cubes
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
For the Filling:
2 tablespoons (30ml) grapeseed or other neutral oil
1 pound yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 3 cups)
1 3/4 ounces (about 1/4 cup, firmly packed) light brown sugar
2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
1/2 cup (120ml) black coffee
1/4 cup (60ml) unsulfured molasses, not blackstrap
1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons sour cream or crème fraîche
2 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs
For the Everything-Bagel Spice Mix and to Finish (see note):
1 teaspoon poppy seeds
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt or pretzel salt
1/2 teaspoon caraway or nigella seeds
1/2 teaspoon dehydrated onion
1/4 teaspoon dehydrated garlic
1 egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon (5ml) cool water","1.
For the Dough: In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, butter, cream cheese, and salt. Pulse 4 to 5 times, then turn the processor on and process until the dough forms a shaggy ball, about 1 minute.
2.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured sheet of plastic wrap and lightly flour your hands. If making crescent cookies, gently form a disk 5 inches in diameter. If making sliced cookies, form dough into a 3- by 4-inch rectangle. Dust surface with flour and wrap tightly. Lightly press with a rolling pin to smooth, then lightly tap the disk or rectangle's edges on the counter. The smoother the edges, the less prone they will be to cracking later on. Chill until the dough registers 40°F (4°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour. The dough may be frozen for 3 months; defrost overnight in the refrigerator to proceed.
3.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Stack 2 baking sheets and line the top one with parchment paper.
4.
For the Filling: In a large heavy pan, such as a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and stir to coat with oil. Cook, stirring regularly, until translucent. Add brown sugar and butter and increase heat to medium-high, cooking and stirring regularly, until onions are deep golden brown and smell sweet, about 8 to 10 minutes.
5.
Add coffee, molasses, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until onions are jammy and very little liquid remains, about 20 minutes. Spread jam across a sheet tray to cool more quickly, cover, and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes.
6.
In a bowl, combine 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of onion jam with sour cream or crème fraîche and stir to combine. Remaining jam can be stored in a container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
7.
For Crescent-Style Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 9-inch circle, using a dinner plate and paring knife to trim edges. Spread filling over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over filling. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut disk into 16 equal wedges. Starting from the wide end of each long triangle, roll up and press on the pointy end to seal. Place seam side down on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining triangles, working quickly and placing cookies about 2 inches apart. Transfer baking sheet to the freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
8.
For Sliced Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 4- by 12-inch rectangle. Spread filling over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the two 12-inch edges. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over filling. Starting at one 12-inch edge, tightly roll dough into a spiral. Aim to make 3 full revolutions, pressing seam firmly to seal. Place roll on baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate for at least 30 and no more than 45 minutes. (If chilled for longer, allow dough to warm very slightly at room temperature, so it will not crack when sliced.) Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut roll into 12 cookies, each the shape of an isosceles trapezoid. Keep the smaller edge of the trapezoid no less than 1/2 inch in length, and the larger edge no more than 1 1/2 inches in length. Place seam side down on baking sheet and transfer to freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
9.
To Make the Everything-Bagel Spice Mix: Combine poppy seeds, sesame seeds, salt, caraway, onion, and garlic in a tightly sealed jar. The mixture will keep indefinitely.
10.
To Finish and Bake: Brush cookies' surface with egg wash using a small pastry brush. Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon Everything-Bagel Spice Mix evenly over surface of cookies. Bake until browned and flaky, about 22 to 25 minutes. Some filling may squish out; that’s okay. The bottoms of the rugelach should be caramelized, not blackened. Transfer the cookies (still on the parchment) to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour. Store in an airtight container, layered between sheets of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month.

With layers of fluffy angel food cake, bittersweet amaro, tart cranberry jam, and creamy whipped mascarpone, this holiday trifle is a celebration of contrasting flavors and textures.

Toasted Sugar Angel Food Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Thanks to toasted sugar, this twist on angel food cake has a subtle sweetness tempered by a caramel edge. Use quick-toasted sugar to add just a hint of caramel, or toast it up to three or for hours for a darker, bittersweet caramel flavor.","Yield:Makes one 10-inch tube cake
Active time: 15 minutes

5 ounces bleached cake flour (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 140g) (see note)
15 ounces cold egg whites (2 cups; 425g) from about 12 large eggs
15 ounces toasted or quick-toasted sugar (2 cups; 425g)
1 tablespoon (15ml) vanilla extract, or 1 vanilla bean pod, split and scraped
1 ounce fresh juice (2 tablespoons; 25g) from 1 lemon
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350°F. Sift cake flour and set aside. Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract (or seeds) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to loosen, about 1 minute, then increase to medium-low (4 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes; the whites will be dense and dark.
2.
With the mixer still running, add lemon juice and salt. Immediately increase to medium (6 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes longer; the meringue will be thin but foamy. Increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid) and continue whipping until the meringue is glossy white and thick enough that you can see the pattern left by the wire whisk; this can take between 2 and 4 minutes, depending on the freshness of the whites and the horsepower of your mixer. When meringue is ready, it should be soft enough to flow off the wires when the whisk attachment is removed, but thick enough to mound up on itself like soft-serve in the bowl.
3.
Sprinkle cake flour on top and stir with a flexible spatula to roughly combine. Switch to a folding motion, scraping from the bottom up and folding through the center, until no pockets of flour remain. Scrape the batter into a 10-inch aluminum tube pan (do not butter or grease pan); if you notice any small pockets of unincorporated flour, simply pause to mix them in. Bake until the cake is puffed, golden blond, and firm to the touch, about 45 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 206°F on an instant-read thermometer.
4.
Invert pan onto its stilts or onto a trio of cans (see note) and cool upside down until absolutely no trace of warmth remains, at least 2 hours. Slide an offset spatula around the sides of cake to loosen, remove the insert, and slide spatula under the bottom as well. Flip onto a serving plate, pulling gently on the sides of the cake to release it from the center tube. To serve, cut with a chef's knife, using a gentle sawing motion and only the slightest downward pressure. If you like, serve with your favorite chocolate sauce or homemade caramel. Wrapped tightly in plastic, leftovers will keep up to 1 week at room temperature.

","Grilled eggplant slices are filled with a four-cheese mixture, then topped with marinara, mozzarella, and Parmesan to make creamy and delicious rollatini. [Photographs: Joshua Bousel]
Making double use of the grill, dish of rollatini starts with eggplant slices that are until tender and browned, then sees them returned to the grill as rollatini in a covered baking dish, just long enough for the cheese to melt and the marinara sauce to heat through.
Why this recipe works:
Eggplant slices that are 1/4 inch thick are sturdy enough to hold together on the grill yet thin enough to roll up once cooked.
Mixing provolone into the filling adds a nice sharpness that's balanced by the creamy and mellow ricotta.
Finishing the dish over an indirect fire makes great use of the remaining heat in the grill.","Yield:serves 4

1/4 to 1/2 cup (100 to 200g) panko-style breadcrumbs
Peanut or canola oil, for frying
1 recipe Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce (see note)","1.
Coarsely chop shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside. Reserve a few tablespoons of sliced scallion greens for serving.
2.
Combine garlic, jalapeño, remaining scallions, cilantro, lime zest, and a large pinch of salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until everything is finely minced. Add half of the shrimp, the mayo, the cornstarch, and the egg white. Pulse until the mixture forms a coarse paste, about 5 or 6 pulses. Add the remaining shrimp and pulse two or three times to combine everything. Some of the shrimp will be chunkier.
3.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add 1/4 cup of the panko breadcrumbs. Fold in with a spatula or your hands. The mixture should be soft and should just hold its shape if you form a ball. If it’s too soft, add more breadcrumbs a little at a time until a ball just holds together. It will stiffen up more when it gets cold. Chill mixture for at least 30 minutes and up to a day.
4.
Once chilled, use wet hands and a tablespoon (or portioning scoop) to form the mixture into bite-sized patties. Transfer to a large plate as you go. When all the patties are formed, heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Fry patties in batches until golden brown and cooked through, turning once, 3 to 4 minutes total.
5.
Serve warm, scattered with cilantro and finely sliced scallions along with dipping sauce.

Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns Recipe,,"[Photograph: Donna Currie]
Sweet pumpkin buns with a hazelnut-graham cracker swirl.
Note: The great thing about this recipe is that you do most of the work the night before, then refrigerate the formed rolls and bake them the next day. But don't let them rest for more than one night. Sooner or later, the dough will over-rise or the gluten will degrade and you'll have a pan full of sludge instead of a pan full of buns.
You can knead this dough by hand, but it takes quite a while—a stand mixer makes the job much, much easier.","Yield:Makes 9 rolls
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:1 day (including overnight rest)","Ingredients
1 cup (about 8 ounces) canned pumpkin purée (not pie filling)
1/2 cup (4 ounces) lukewarm water
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 cup sugar
13 1/2 ounces (about 2 1/2 cups) bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature
Non-stick baking spray
1/4 cup hazelnut meal
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
2 teaspoons cinnamon","1.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the pumpkin purée, water, yeast, sugar, and bread flour. Knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the salt and butter and continue kneading until the butter is completely incorporated into the dough, a few minutes longer. Alternatively, knead by hand.
2.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour. The dough should have visibly risen, but it won't double in size. Flour your work surface and spray a 9-inch square pan with baking spray.
3.
Turn out the dough and form it into a rough square. With a rolling pin, roll into a rough 10- by 8-inch rectangle.
4.
In a small bowl, combine the hazelnut meal, sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly over the top of the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch uncovered on one of the long sides. Starting from the other long side, roll the dough up loosely, and when you reach the uncovered edge, seal the seam by pinching it together. If there are any sections of the dough that are fatter, roll it gently so the whole roll is approximately the same diameter.
5.
Cut the roll into nine even pieces. Place the pieces, cut side down, in the pan. The filling is quite loose and will want to come out as you lift the pieces. The easiest way to move them without losing a lot of filling is to flip the pieces onto a large dough scraper and move the to the pan and slide them off. When you've moved all nine pieces to the pan, scoop up any of the filling that's left on the counter and sprinkle it over the buns. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or put it in a large plastic bag and close the bag. Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours
6.
When you're ready to bake, remove the pan from the refrigerator and let it rest on the counter while you preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the plastic wrap (or remove the pan from the plastic bag) and bake at 350°F until the buns are nicely browned, about 40 minutes. If you're not sure if the buns are done, you can take the dough's temperature—it should be about 200°F, but make sure you're checking the temperature of the dough and not the sugar filling.
7.
Let the pan cool on a rack. Drizzle the buns with a sugar icing, if desired (powdered sugar and just a bit of water to reach a drizzling consistency).

Chinese Red-Sauce-Glazed Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Inspired by a classic Chinese cooking technique of braising meat in a brothy mixture of soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, sugar, and aromatics like ginger, cinnamon, and star anise, this turkey recipe reimagines those flavors as a sticky, sweet-salty glaze. The result is a turkey with a deep, dark glaze that's profoundly savory and concentrated, infused with the aroma and flavor of the ginger and spices. It's also more than enough to fully season the bird, so there's no need to add any other salt at all.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:2 hours 15 minutes","Ingredients
1 cup (235ml) dark soy sauce
1 cup (235ml) Shaoxing wine
1 cup sugar (8 ounces; 225g)
1 cinnamon stick
2 pieces star anise
2 (1-inch) knobs peeled fresh ginger, lightly crushed under the heel of a knife, divided
4 scallions, divided
3 large onions, roughly chopped (about 1 1/2 quarts; 1 1/2 pounds; 680g), divided
4 ribs celery, roughly chopped (about 1 quart; 12 ounces; 340g), divided
1 whole turkey (12 to 14 pounds total; 5.5 to 6.3kg), butterflied according to these instructions, backbone, neck, and giblets reserved
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, divided
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","1.
In a medium saucepan, stir together soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and sugar until sugar is mostly dissolved. Add cinnamon, star anise, 1 knob of ginger, and 2 scallions. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Lower heat to a bare simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is lightly syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 40 minutes. Set aside.
2.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scatter two-thirds of onions and celery across pan. Place a wire rack directly on top of vegetables.
3.
Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil all over turkey. Using a pastry brush, apply a thin layer of glaze to underside of turkey only. Place turkey skin side up on top of rack, tuck wing tips behind back, and arrange so turkey does not overlap the baking sheet edges, pressing down on breastbone to flatten breasts slightly.
4.
Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into deepest part of breast registers 150°F (66°C) and thighs register at least 165°F (74°C), about 1 hour 20 minutes. During last 20 minutes of cooking, apply several coats of glaze all over turkey skin with pastry brush, roasting for 5 minutes between each coat, until turkey is covered in a deep-brown, sticky glaze.
5.
While turkey roasts, make jus. Roughly chop reserved neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, celery, ginger, and scallions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, about 5 minutes longer. Add chicken stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer until reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from surface of broth. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm.
6.
When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into jus.
7.
Carve turkey and serve with jus.

","Unlike the better-known gnocchi made from potato, these are made with semolina, a durum wheat flour. [Photographs: Vicky Wasik, unless otherwise noted]
Long before ships brought native crops from the Americas to Europe, Italy was a land without red sauce, corn polenta, or potato gnocchi. But even without the potato, gnocchi still existed, such as in the form of the classic gnocchi alla Romana, this custardy oven-baked version made with semolina, egg, cheese, and butter. You could say these are the OG: the original gnocchi.
Why this recipe works:
Stirring the butter and cheese into the semolina before the egg helps reduce the temperature just enough, so that the yolks won't scramble when they go in.
Wetting hands and tools when working with the semolina dough prevents sticking.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6 as a pasta or main course and 8 as a side or appetizer
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes
Rated: 3","Ingredients
6 cups milk
Kosher salt
1 1/2 cups semolina flour
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, plus more for greasing
1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for grating
3 egg yolks, lightly beaten","1.
In a large saucepan, heat milk over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally to prevent scorching, until steaming. Season well with salt. While whisking constantly, sprinkle in semolina in a fine shower to prevent lumps; the mixture will thicken and become difficult to whisk. Once all semolina is added, lower heat to medium-low, switch to a stiff rubber spatula or wooden spoon and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until a sticky, dough-like mass forms and begins to pull away from sides of saucepan, 10 to 15 minutes; make sure to stir deep into corners and all over bottom of saucepan to prevent scorching. Remove from heat.
2.
Stir in 4 tablespoons of butter until melted and thoroughly incorporated. Stir in cheese until melted and thoroughly incorporated. Scrape in egg yolks and stir until thoroughly incorporated.
3.
Scrape semolina dough into a buttered rimmed baking sheet. Using a wet rubber spatula or wet clean hands, and re-wetting frequently to prevent sticking, press and smooth semolina dough into an even layer about 1/2 inch thick. It's okay if the dough does not fully reach all edges of the baking sheet, as long as it's even throughout. Press plastic wrap against the surface and refrigerate until set, at least 40 minutes and up to overnight.
4.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter or similarly sized glass, cut semolina into rounds (scraps can be saved and refrigerated for up to 4 days: deep fry in oil for a snack, or assemble in a smaller baking dish to make a mini version of this dish). Grease a large baking dish or ovenproof skillet with butter. Using a thin metal spatula, scrape each semolina round from the baking sheet and arrange in an overlapping pattern in the prepared dish or skillet.
5.
Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and drizzle all over semolina gnocchi. Grate Parmigiano-Reggiano generously all over. Bake until gnocchi are sizzling hot and browned on top, about 15 minutes. Serve, passing more grated cheese at the table.

Steamed Buns With Tempura King Oyster Mushrooms and Agave-Miso Mayonnaise (Vegan) Recipe,,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Chinese-style steamed buns stuffed with tempura-fried simmered king oyster mushrooms and an agave-miso mayonnaise.
Note: Mirin is a sweet Japanese rice wine that can be found in most supermarkets or Asian grocers. If unavailable, substitute an extra half cup of sake and sugar.","Yield:makes enough for 12 steamed buns, serving 4 to 6 as an appetizer
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour","Ingredients
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup sake
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup mirin (see note)
2 king oyster mushrooms, about 6 inches long and 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide
1 quart vegetable, canola, or peanut oil
1/2 cup corn starch
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup ice-cold club soda
Kosher salt
12 Chinese sandwich-style steamed buns (bao)
1 recipe Miso-Agave Mayonnaise
1 1/2 cups finely shredded iceberg lettuce
4 scallions, very thinly sliced on an extreme bias, stored in a bowl of cold water in the fridge
1/2 cup picked fresh cilantro leaves","1.
Combine soy sauce, sake, sugar, mirin, and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and whisk until sugar is dissolved. Add king oyster mushrooms. Place a clean, lint-free paper towel or kitchen towel directly on the surface of the liquid, pressing down until it is completely saturated and keeps the mushrooms partially submerged. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce to maintain a bare simmer. Cook until mushrooms are completely tender (a cake tester or paring knife inserted should meet little resistance as it goes through), about 30 minutes, flipping mushrooms once halfway through cooking.
2.
Remove mushrooms from liquid and dry carefully with paper towels. Return remaining liquid to a gently boil over medium heat and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. When mushrooms are cool enough to handle, slice each into 12 disks about 1/2-inch wide.
3.
Heat oil in a large wok, saucepan, or deep fryer to 350°F and adjust flame to maintain temperature.
4.
Combine cornstarch and flour in a large bowl and stir with chopsticks until roughly combined. Add soda and stir very rapidly with chopsticks while shaking bowl. Do not overmix—there should be plenty of lumps and bubbles. Add sliced mushrooms to bowl and turn to coat. Working one piece at a time, lift mushroom, allow excess batter to drip off, then slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat until all mushrooms are in the oil. Cook mushrooms, agitating oil and turning mushrooms occasionally with a wire mesh spider or long chopsticks until pale golden brown and completely crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt immediately.
5.
Place steamed buns on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high power until hot, about 1 minute. Spread miso mayonnaise in each steamed bun, then add shredded lettuce, two fried mushroom slices, a drizzle of the reduced simmering liquid, sliced scallions, and cilantro leaves. Close sandwiches and serve with extra miso mayonnaise on the side for dipping.

Michael Neff's Gin-Applejack Punch Recipe,,"[Photograph: Robyn Lee]
We asked Michael Neff of Ward III in Tribeca to design a cocktail that we could make in a big batch for a party.
The only ingredient we stipulated was applejack; we love the oaky vanilla notes and baked-apple flavor of Cornelius Applejack and the caramelized, spicy apple and brown sugar flavor of Laird's Applejack (both were review samples.) But we didn't want typical fall flavors: no ginger or nutmeg, no cinnamon. Been there, done that.
Neff has a way with requests: he makes drinks better than anything we might be imagining when we order them. He threw in the applejack, but then added gin, which contributes a perfect piney freshness. Lime and orange juices brighten it up, adding sunny flavor to the potent punch. Though you could just use juice, muddling the orange to get the oils from the peel adds a delicately bitter complexity that straight juice just doesn't match.
Make this drink a few hours ahead of the party and store it in a bottle in your fridge, Michael Dietsch-style.",Yield:serves 5,"Ingredients
2 oranges
8 dashes Angostura bitters
6 ounces gin
6 ounces Applejack
2 1/2 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice from about 5 limes
2 ounces simple syrup
5 ounces water
Large block of ice for serving
Thin lime slices for garnish","1.
8 hours in advance, make a large ice block (or extra-large ice cubes) for serving.
2.
Meanwhile, a few hours before serving, cut oranges into slices and muddle a few at a time in shaker. Strain and discard pulp and orange peel. When you have 2 ounces of juice, add Angostura bitters. Pour into resealable 750-milliliter bottle (using funnel if desired.)
3.
Add gin, applejack, lime juice, simple syrup, and water. Seal bottle and shake to blend. Refrigerate until completely chilled. Serve in a punch bowl over ice, garnishing with lime slices.

Easy Mexican Wedding Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
These simple pecan shortbreads couldn't be any easier: Just toast the pecans and powdered sugar together, cool, and blitz with the remaining ingredients in a food processor. The dough is only lightly sweetened, which helps the cookies retain their round, snowball-like shape, but a dusting of powdered sugar brings them back into balance. I like these best with a mug of hot cocoa, but they're great with milk or tea as well.","Yield:Makes 20 cookies
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:50 minutes","Ingredients
For the Dough:
2 ounces raw pecan halves (1/2 cup; 55g)
1 1/2 ounces powdered sugar (1/3 cup; 40g) (see note)
4 ounces all-purpose flour (3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 110g)
4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 110g), cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 teaspoon (5g) vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
To Finish:
2 ounces powdered sugar (1/2 cup; 55g), divided (see note)","1.
For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Combine pecans and powdered sugar in a 10-inch stainless steel skillet and toast in oven until fragrant but not deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes. When pecans and sugar have cooled to room temperature, combine with flour, cold butter, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon in the bowl of a food processor. (Save the skillet for step 2.) Pulse until pecan pieces disappear, then continue pulsing to form a stiff dough.
2.
To Finish: Sprinkle about half of powdered sugar into skillet, then divide dough into 20 half-ounce portions (I use a #60 scoop). Tumble each piece in powdered sugar until fully coated and roll into a ball. When all pieces have been rounded up, shake skillet so the cookie dough rolls around, collecting more sugar. Arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan and bake until puffed and firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan and sift remaining powdered sugar on top.

"Serious Salads: Arugula, Apples and Manchego in Cider Vinaigrette Recipe",,"Perfect for autumn, this Spanish-style salad combines peppery arugula, juicy apples, crunchy almonds and Manchego, the deliciously piquant sheep's milk cheese from the region of La Mancha in Spain. Tossed in a cider vinaigrette, it's got that salty-sweet-tangy flavor combination that everyone loves.
If you can find a Manchego that's been aged over six months, it will have a more distinctive flavor. Also, be sure to assemble the salad right before serving. Arugula tends to wilt quickly once it's dressed, and slice the apples at the last minute to avoid discoloration (or if you want to do it ahead of time, you can toss them with a little lemon juice).","Yield:4
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:15 minutes","Ingredients
For the Salad:
5 ounces arugula or baby arugula
1 crisp apple, such as Fuji
3 1/2 ounces manchego, thinly sliced
1/2 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted if desired
For the Vinaigrette:
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
6 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil
2 teaspoons (real) maple syrup
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots, from one shallot

Right before serving, cut apple into thin slices and toss into salad along with Manchego and almonds. Taste and adjust seasoning, then serve immediately.

Grilling: Acorn Squash with Asiago and Sage Recipe,,"Carving a pumpkin last week got me thinking about about the possibility of taking one to the grill. Although I stand by my initial thoughts that it would be delicious, the logistics of size and time to take to make it edible were a bit to much, and so I looked to a smaller, more manageable counterpart, the acorn squash.
After halving and gutting the squash, I brushed them with a seasonally appropriate mixture of butter, brown sugar, sage, maple syrup, granulated onion, and salt and pepper. Then they went on the cool side of a two zone fire for an hour--sprinkled with Asiago cheese half way through--until perfectly tender. The resulting squash was creamy and sweet, with just enough nuttiness from the cheese to make it a great savory side for fall grilling.
Acorn Squash with Asiago and Sage",,"Ingredients
3 acorn squashes, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
3 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage
1 teaspoon granulated onion
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup freshly grated aged Asiago cheese","1.
Light a chimney 3/4 full of charcoal. While the fire is lighting, carefully cut each squash in half lengthwise with a large knife. Scoop out and discard the seeds and strings.
2.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of the sage, granulated onion, maple syrup, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Brush butter mixture all over the exposed flesh of each squash.
3.
When charcoal is fully lit and covered in gray ash, pour coals out and arrange them on one side of the charcoal grate, keeping the other side empty. Place squash, cut side up, on the cool side of the grill, cover and grill for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese all over the exposed flesh of each squash. Cover and continue to grill until the flesh is very soft when pierced with the tip of a knife and the cheese has browned, about 30 minutes more. Sprinkle with remaining sage and serve warm.

2 tablespoons pitted chopped olives
1 1/2 ounces prosciutto, excess fat removed, sliced into thin ribbons (about 1/4 cup)
1 1/2 ounces pecorino or parmesan cheese, shaved into thin slices with a vegetable peeler (about 1/4 cup)
4 teaspoons juice and 1/2 teaspoon zest from 1 lemon
2 teaspoons whole grain or dijon mustard","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Place grain in a medium saucepan, cover with water by 2 inches, and season heavily with salt.

Chocolate Orange Cream Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
Note: Steeping the milk is critical for the bright orange flavor of the filling. For the best zest, wash the oranges well with a little soap and warm water, then carefully scrape the zest with a microplane, taking care to get just the orange and none of the white pith, which will impart a bitter flavor. Bring the milk and zest just to a boil, then turn off the heat and allow it to steep for at least 20 minutes before straining. This will deliver the best and brightest orange flavor.","Yield:serves 8 people
Active time: 2 hours
Total time:8 hours

One half recipe Easy Pie Dough, shaped and chilled in a pie plate
16 ounces whole milk
2 tablespoons orange zest (from approximately 2 oranges)
13 ounces 65% chocolate, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces or smaller
5 tablespoons corn syrup
Pinch of salt
4 ounces mascarpone cheese
6 ounces heavy cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
Optional garnish: candied orange zest","1.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line the bottom and sides of the chilled, shaped pie crust with parchment or foil and fill with pie weights (I re-use dried beans for this purpose). On the bottom rack of the oven, bake the shell for 20 minutes rotating halfway through, then remove the weights and liner and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the bottom of the pie is golden brown. Remove the shell from the oven and allow it to cool completely.
2.
In a medium-sized saucepan, combine milk and orange zest. Bring them just to a boil over medium heat, then remove from heat and allow them to sit for 20 minutes. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer to remove the zest, and return the infused milk to a clean, medium-sized saucepan. Combine chopped chocolate, salt, and corn syrup in a large bowl. Bring milk just to a boil, then pour milk over the chocolate mixture and allow it to sit for 2 minutes. Then, stir milk and chocolate mixture until all of the chocolate is melted. Pour mixture back into the saucepan over low heat, and stir continuously for approximately 8 minutes, taking care to prevent the mixture from burning on the bottom of the pan. The mixture will thicken and begin to bubble. Continue stirring until it has thickened to the consistency of pudding. Remove from heat and pour the filling into the pie shell. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling (not over the crust), and chill for at least 4 hours (overnight is ideal).
3.
To serve: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cream and confectioner's together until the cream has thickened but does not yet hold soft peaks. Add the mascarpone and whip until the mixture holds medium peaks. Top pie with the whipped mixture and decorate with candied orange zest (if desired). Serve immediately.

"Anchovy, Red Pepper, and Manchego Pintxos Recipe",,"Photographs: Marvin Gapultos
Some of the best drink-friendly snacks come impaled on any number of sticks and skewers. It seems that satays, kebabs, and even corn dogs are all designed to be eaten with one hand, while a cool beverage is held in the other. But the Spanish have their own arsenal of foods-on-a-stick called Pintxos (or pinchos) that are easy to prepare and meant for sharing with friends.
Pintxos are similar to tapas in that they are small snacks served in bars; however, pintxos are usually speared with a skewer or toothpick and anchored to a piece of crusty bread. Pintxos are great in that they are infinitely adaptable to any number of flavors and ingredients. Shrimp and pickled peppers, ham and melon, smoked salmon and eggs—anything really, can be pierced onto a round of bread.
For this recipe, anchovy fillets, roasted red peppers, and Manchego cheese are spiked onto a garlic-rubbed baguette round and quickly toasted under the broiler. A drizzle of sherry vinegar right before serving provides some sharp acidity to cut through the saltiness of the anchovy, and nuttiness of the cheese. Salty, tangy, and crisp, these pintxos are great pre-cursors to a glass of wine or beer.","Yield:Makes 12 hors d'oeuvres, serving 4 to 6

12 (1/2-inch) slices of baguette

12 olive oil-packed anchovy fillets, drained
Sherry vinegar, for drizzling
12 toothpicks or small wooden skewers, for serving","1.
Brush both sides of the baguette slices with the olive oil, then place the baguette slices on a baking sheet. Lightly toast the bread directly under the broiler until golden brown, 30-seconds to 1 minute per side. Remove the bread from the broiler and rub the top of each baguette slice with the cut side of the garlic.

2.
Line a heatproof plate with a paper towel, arrange rosemary sprigs (making sure they are dry) on top, and top with another sheet of paper towel. Microwave on high until rosemary is completely dry, 1 to 2 minutes (keep an eye on it as it can quickly burn if continued to cook after drying). Remove rosemary needles from sprigs, discarding woody stalks, and pulverize needles in a mortar and pestle to a powder. Sift dried rosemary powder through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl to remove any remaining large pieces.

Squash and Apple Soup with Beet and Bacon Recipe,,"[Photograph: Nick Kindelsperger]
I like summer and all, but when the leaves start changing and the weather cools, I start getting uncontrollably hungry. This can cause problems. Like, say, when I get back from the store with just about every fall vegetable known to man, convincing myself that it's totally reasonable to add each and every one of them into the same pot of soup. Luckily, my better sense came through, and I edited the soup down to a delicata squash (another type of winter squash would also work) and apple soup. Sounds great, right? But then I looked over at the counter and a bunch of beets were looking at me, begging to find a way in.
Though I could have just tossed them in, I knew it would change the color from a gorgeous autumnal gold to a muddy red. But what if I could add the beets separately at the end? Along with sweetness, the chopped up beets would also add some much needed texture to the blended soup.
Thing is, beets take a long time to roast whole. Though not a huge deal, I wanted to see if I could get the cooking time under half an hour. Cutting the beets into wedges and then roasting them helped tremendously. But I also took some guidance from Barbara Kafka's Vegetable Love. She recommends, of all techniques, microwaving: ""When baked, the beets retain a maximum of color and flavor. Microwave cooking achieves the same effect rapidly and with almost no mess."" I understand that some of you wouldn't dream of opening up your microwaves, so I've included both recipes so you can decide.
The result is everything I wanted. The blended soup is tart and creamy, while the beets add a pop of color and some much needed sweetness. Bacon lends some meatiness, while the drizzle of yogurt (or sour cream) adds tang.","Yield:serves 4 to 6
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:45 minutes","Ingredients
1 pound beets (about 2 medium)sliced into 8 wedges
4 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 medium garlic cloves, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
2 pounds delicata squash (about 2 medium), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 1/2 tart apples, peeled, cored, and chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
4 cups low sodium canned or homemade chicken stock
1/2 cup yogurt or sour cream
3 tablespoons chopped chives","1.
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place beets on a rimmed baking sheet and cover tightly with coil. Cook until tender or a knife can easily slip into the skin, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, discard foil, and let cool. Peel off the skins and chop into 1/4-inch cubes. To microwave the beets: Place the beets in a small microwave-safe dish, and cover with plastic wrap. Cook for ten minutes. Carefully peel off the plastic wrap, and check if a knife can easily slip in the skin. If not, cook for an additional two to four minutes until tender. When done, let cool for a few minutes, peel the skins off, and chop into 1/4-inch cubes.
2.
Add the bacon to a large heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until bacon has rendered its fat and starts to crisp up. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon. Discard all but two tablespoons of the fat.

This version is made in the slow cooker and includes a bit of chicken stock, milk, and heavy cream, which is thickened on the stove before being poured on top of ribbons of kale. Romano cheese adds nuttiness and binds the sauce, along with a pinch of nutmeg and a little crushed red pepper. Right before serving, a touch of lemon zest brightens the dish.
Why this recipe works:
A quick and easy cream sauce is prepared on the stove, then poured over ribbons of kale and finished at leisure in the slow cooker.
Aged Romano, chicken stock, nutmeg and crushed red pepper prevent the sauce from being one-note.
A final shower of lemon zest brings this side dish to life.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8

Pumpkin Chocolate Swirl Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
Chocolate and pumpkin is not the most intuitive combination, but something magical happens when you combine the two in this riff on pumpkin pie. This pie is not aggressively chocolaty, but if you're looking for something new this Thanksgiving, try adding a swirl of subtle cocoa flavor to your pumpkin pie routine.
This recipe was inspired by one from Ken Haedrich's book Pie.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:4 hours (not including making the dough)","Ingredients
One half recipe Easy Pie Dough, shaped and chilled in a pie plate
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
12 ounces cream cheese
14 ounces granulated sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
8 ounces pumpkin or butternut squash puree
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
pinch of salt","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (I reuse dried beans for this), and bake on the lowest rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until the bottom crust is a golden brown (or slightly lighter, if you prefer that style), about 10 minutes. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely.
2.
Place the butter in a small, microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, until the butter is melted. Add the chocolate to the bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, stop and stir the chocolate, and then return the mixture to the microwave for another 30 seconds. Continue to do this, stirring each time, until the mixture is completely melted, smooth, and shiny. Set aside.
3.
Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. In a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream the cream cheese on medium speed. Add the sugar and cream until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, and mix well after each addition. Lower the mixer speed and blend in the pumpkin, spices, vanilla, and salt until the mixture is evenly combined.
4.
Pour half of the mixture into the baked pie shell (reserve the other half of the mixture in the bowl) and place in the oven for 10 minutes to help it partially set. Add the chocolate mixture to the remaining pumpkin mixture and stir until it is homogenous. After ten minutes, remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Then, pour the chocolate mixture over the top slowly and gently. Drag a spatula through the filling, scooping upward to create a swirled, marbled effect. Return the pie to the oven and bake for 35 - 40 minutes, until the filling has set completely and puffs a bit at the edges. Allow the pie to cool completely (during which time it will deflate a bit). It may be stored in the fridge for up to two days (highly recommend no more than one for best flavor).

Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch Squares Recipe,,"[Photograph: Alexandra Penfold]
For a quick snack for a crowd, try these easy peanut butter cereal bars topped with dark chocolate.
While Leandra may be the biggest cerealphile among us, I always appreciate a good cereal-based dessert. And there's no reason cereal treats need to be confined to Rice Krispies or their crisp rice generic counterparts. Cereal + butter + marshmallows = delicious. Add chocolate to that mix and hello, easy treatland!
Chocolate and peanut butter are a dynamic dessert duo and a proven one in cereal treat form (check out these Scotcharoos). The other day as I was brainstorming easy and different desserts for Super Bowl Sunday, my wheels started spinning, what if you made marshmallowy cereal squares with Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch? What if you added chocolate? For the sake of science, dear readers, I went there. And if you're looking for a tasty and super easy dessert to make for game day, you'll want to go here, too.
Note: Using semi-sweet chocolate chips makes this recipe super easy, but if you're a diehard dark chocolate fan you can further choco-fy this is recipe by splurging on 12 ounces of quality dark chocolate (70% cacao or higher) and chopping it into chocolate chip-sized pieces then following the instructions below. Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch purists can omit the chocolate, if desired.","Yield:Serves 20
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:2 hours","Ingredients
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
1 (10 ounce) bag mini-marshmallows
1 (18 ounce) box Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch
1 pinch Kosher salt
12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted in a double boiler or microwave","1.
Grease a 9- by 13- inch baking dish and set aside. Place butter in a large stockpot (I used a 7 quart one, you will need to fit the marshmallows and an entire box of cereal with room for stirring) and melt the butter over medium heat.
2.
Add marshmallows, stirring frequently until marshmallows are completely melted and the butter is incorporated. Reduce heat to low. Quickly add the cereal, stirring until ingredients are fully incorporated. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Spray a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper cooking spray and use it to gently press the cereal mixture into the pan and distribute it easily. Sprinkle with salt. Spread melted chocolate on top and let cool until set, about 1 1/2 hours. Slice and serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Healthy & Delicious: Carrot and Sweet Potato Mash Recipe,,"Editor's note: On Mondays, Kristen Swensson Sturt of Cheap, Healthy, Good swings by these parts to share healthy and delicious recipes with us. Take it away, Kristen!
[Photograph: Kristen Swensson Sturt]
This? Is nothing special to look at. It is, in two words, very orange.
But, for those of you A) looking for a healthier alternative to mashed potatoes, B) feeding picky children and/or adults, or C), who like orange, this is the motherlode.
Adapted from a popular side dish from All Recipes, Carrot and Sweet Potato Mash is a powerhouse of solid nutrition and appealing flavor. For one thing, you will never find a recipe with more Vitamin A, though the allotments of fiber and Vitamin C aren't too shabby, either. For another thing, well, it's just really, really good.
Despite a slight textural difference, the carrots and sweet potatoes mesh (or is it mash?) unexpectedly well. The addition of unsweetened applesauce and brown sugar make the dish moist and ever-so-slightly sweet, while the raisins, quite literally, give you something to chew on.
Oh, and while adults will appreciate this recipe, kids will go absolutely nutso bonkers insane for this. Try it on your family today, especially if they're into the color orange.","Yield:4 to 6

Flourless Chocolate-Chestnut Torte Recipe,,"Chestnut purée makes this torte a perfect wintertime dessert. [Photogrphas: Yvonne Ruperti]
This rich and luxurious flourless chestnut-and-chocolate torte is flavored with bourbon and topped with a swirl of sweetened chestnut puree. It's the perfect end to a wintertime holiday meal.
Why this recipe works:
The mild flavor of chestnut in the chocolate torte is enhanced with bourbon.
Swirls of chestnut purée on top add even more chestnut flavor.
Chopped nuts in the torte add crunch.
Notes:A potato ricer creates the spaghetti-like strands of chestnut purée to top the torte. Adjust the consistency of the purée so that you can easily push the purée through the ricer with the strands still able to hold their shape.","Yield:Makes one 9-inch cake
Active time: 30 minutes

Caramelized Vidalia Onion Mashed Potatoes Recipe,,"Slowly caramelized onions lend a touch of sweetness (and plenty of interest) to creamy mashed potatoes. [Photograph: Jennifer Olvera]
Mashed potatoes are a crowd-pleaser—that's a statement of fact. But if you're looking to change things up, ones stippled with caramelized onion offer a perfect fix. Here, they're made extra creamy with lots of butter, milk, sour cream, and a touch of cream cheese. Mash them by hand if you like to leave a bit of texture (I do); otherwise, briefly whip them with a hand-beater before folding the sweet, slowly caramelized onions into the mix.
Speaking of onions, don't try to rush the caramelization process. I've found it works best to ""steam"" them, lid-on, at a low temperature for about 20 minutes before adding a touch of sugar. Then, raise the heat and let them brown, adding small amounts of water and stirring so they don't burn. You can also cut some corners and give our 15-minute caramelized onions a shot.
Note: You may prepare the potatoes up to two days in advance. Store them in the refrigerator and microwave them, covered, for about 8 minutes before serving. If they seem a little dry, add additional milk in 1/4 cup increments.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6

2 large Vidalia onions, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)
1/4 teaspoon sugar
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup sour cream
4 ounces cream cheese","1.
Cover potatoes with salted water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer uncovered until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
2.
Meanwhile heat 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a large sauté pan over low heat until melted. Add onions, cover, and cook, stirring periodically until soft and translucent, about 15 minutes. Remove cover, add sugar, season with salt and pepper and stir. Raise heat to medium-high and allow to caramelize, stirring often and adding water a tablespoon at a time if onions begin to burn, about 15 minutes longer.
3.
When potatoes are done cooking, drain in a colander and return to pan. Add remaining 5 tablespoons butter, milk, sour cream and cream cheese. Mash potatoes by hand using a potato masher, leaving some texture. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4.
Fold in onions. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed. Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator for up to two days and reheat in a covered heavy dish in the oven or on the stovetop over low heat, stirring frequently.

Vodka-cranberry just got a lot more sophisticated. Lemon juice and orange bitters add citrusy flavor and a hint of bitterness, while a rosemary honey introduces an herbal note.

Gingerbread Ice Cream Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]

With a brown sugar base to play up the molasses notes of gingerbread, this ice cream has all the hearty flavor you'd expect from a gingerbread cookie—although you can also doctor the spices to taste before churning. It pairs brilliantly with the cranberry jam from our holiday trifle and makes a fun twist on cherry pie à la mode.","Yield:Makes 1 heaping quart
Active time: 25 minutes
Total time:5 hours
Rated: 3.5","Ingredients
5 1/2 ounces light or dark brown sugar (about 2/3 cup, gently packed; 145g)
4 ounces egg yolk (about 1/2 cup; 110g), from about 8 large eggs
3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more as needed; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
6 3/4 ounces gingerbread cookie crumbs (about 1 1/2 cups; 190g), from store-bought or homemade gingerbread cookies, plus more for mix-ins and garnishing
9 ounces heavy cream (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 255g)

1/4 ounce orange liqueur, such as Cointreau, or whatever sounds tasty (about 1/2 tablespoon; 7g), optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Kosher salt (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper or other complementary spices (optional)
Chilled Homemade Caramel Sauce, optional","1.
Combine brown sugar, egg yolks, salt, and baking soda in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, then whisk in cookie crumbs, cream, and milk. Cook over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until warm to the touch. Increase heat to medium, stirring and scraping constantly with a flexible spatula, and cook until steaming-hot, about 8 minutes or to 155°F (68°C). Stir in liqueur and vanilla and season to taste with salt, black pepper, and/or additional spices if desired. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a large stainless steel bowl, pressing gently with a flexible spatula to release the liquid trapped in the crumbs.
2.
Fill a sink compartment or extra-large bowl with a few inches of ice water and place bowl of custard inside, stirring from time to time, until cool, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40°F (4°C), about 4 hours. (The ice cream base can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week.) Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer’s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer.
3.
When ice cream looks thick and light, shut off the machine and scrape ice cream into chilled container, using chilled spatula. If desired, layer ice cream with chilled caramel sauce and an extra handful of crushed gingerbread cookies, in pieces as large or small as you like. Enjoy as soft-serve, or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until hard, about 4 hours. If well protected from freezer burn, the ice cream can be kept in the freezer for more than a month.

Oysters Oaxacafeller Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
There are a lot of subpar riffs on classic oysters Rockefeller out there, but this isn't one of them. For our reimagined take on this New Orleans classic, we turned to Mexican rajas. The gentle heat of roasted poblano peppers, creamy tang of Mexican crema, and brightness of fresh cilantro and lime are much better suited to briny oysters than the drab combination of wilted spinach and heavy cream used in many Rockefeller recipes.","Yield:Makes 24 oysters
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour","Ingredients
Vegetable cooking spray
2 medium poblano peppers (6 1/4 ounces; 175g), stemmed, halved lengthwise, and seeded
4 large scallions (3 1/2 ounces; 100g)
2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) unsalted butter
2 large shallots (4 ounces; 115g), thinly sliced
2 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Kosher salt
1/2 cup (4 ounces; 115g) Mexican crema or sour cream or crème fraîche
Finely grated zest of 1 lime
1/8 teaspoon (1/2g) ground coriander seed
1 tablespoon (15ml) mezcal (optional)
1/2 bunch (about 1 1/2 cups; 30g) fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped
1/2 cup (1 ounce; 30g) panko bread crumbs
Rock (ice cream) salt (see note)
24 fresh oysters, scrubbed
Cayenne pepper
Lime wedges, for serving","1.
Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray it lightly with vegetable cooking spray. Lightly coat skins of poblano peppers and scallions with vegetable oil; then place on prepared baking sheet with peppers facing skin-side up. Broil vegetables, checking them frequently, until they are soft and lightly charred, 5 to 8 minutes.
2.
Set scallions aside on cutting board. Pile poblanos in middle of the sheet of aluminum foil; then gather foil around peppers to form a sealed pouch. Let peppers steam in the foil until their skins can be easily peeled away from the flesh. Using a paring knife, peel and discard skins. Cut poblanos and scallions into 1/2-inch pieces.
3.
In a medium (3-quart) saucepan, heat butter over medium-low heat until foaming. Add shallots, garlic, and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Add poblanos and scallions, and continue to cook until vegetables have released all of their liquid, and liquid has evaporated, another 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in crema, lime zest, and ground coriander. Continue to cook until mixture is well-combined and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in mezcal (if using). Transfer mixture to food processor bowl.
4.
Process vegetables, scraping down sides of food processor bowl as needed, into a coarse paste, about 30 seconds. Add cilantro and process until it is broken down and well-combined with the vegetable paste. Add panko bread crumbs, and pulse until they are fully incorporated. Season with salt, erring on the side of less salt since oysters are briny. Transfer mixture to disposable pastry bag or small mixing bowl, and set aside. If using a mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap, pressing plastic against surface of the paste to prevent skin from forming and herbs from oxidizing. If not serving immediately, mixture can be stored in refrigerator for up to 1 day; let sit at room temperature to soften before using.
5.
Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Line rimmed baking sheet with an even 1/2-inch layer of rock salt. Shuck oysters and arrange on prepared baking sheet. Pipe or spoon topping over oysters; then use an offset spatula or butter knife to smooth topping and fully cover each oyster.
6.
Broil oysters, checking frequently, until topping begins to brown, and oysters are warmed through, 4 to 6 minutes. Lightly season oysters with cayenne. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges and plenty of mezcal at the table.

1 bay leaf
1 whole star anise
2 tablespoons (10g) barberries (see note)
1/3 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt (2 1/2 ounces; 70g)
Freshly ground black pepper","1.
Wash and peel carrots, taking care to scrub out any dirt lodged between the carrot tops and the crowns of the carrots. Trim carrot tops, leaving only 1 inch attached on each. Using a vegetable peeler, peel carrots lengthwise to create long strips. Cover strips with a damp kitchen towel and set aside. Once most of each carrot has been peeled and only a slender core remains, split remaining carrot in half lengthwise. Repeat with the rest of the carrot cores and set aside in a shallow dish, along with half of dill.
2.
In a small pot, combine 3/4 cup (170ml) water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil and pour over carrot pieces. Set aside to pickle at least 1 hour at room temperature and up to overnight in the fridge.
3.
Just before serving the salad, melt ghee or butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, bay leaf, and star anise and toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove spices and add barberries to the hot fat. Transfer hot fat and barberries to a large bowl. Stir in yogurt and 2 tablespoons pickling liquid and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Gently toss carrot strips in the dressing. Drain pickled carrots and chop remaining dill, then fold both into the salad. Serve right away.

1/3 cup (80ml) hot sauce of your choice, or to taste
Paprika, for garnish
Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish","1.
Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish and set aside. Mince 5 cloves of the garlic and add to a large saucepan. Add 4 cups (950ml) water, 1 cup (235ml) tahini, and the cumin. Whisk to combine. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a gentle boil; lower heat to maintain gentle boil. Whisk in chickpea flour a little at a time until fully combined. Whisk in salt and pepper. Continue to cook, whisking often, until batter is thickened and just beginning to pull away from the edges of the pot. Whisk in lemon juice, adjust seasonings to taste, and remove from heat.
2.
Quickly transfer chickpea mixture to greased baking dish, using a spatula to spread it into an even layer. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours.
3.
Combine remaining 1 cup tahini, remaining 1 clove garlic, and hot sauce in the bowl of a food processor and process until well combined. Slowly stream in cold water, with food processor running, until mixture is thinned to the desired consistency. Alternatively, mince garlic and whisk with tahini and hot sauce in a large bowl until smooth, thinning with water as necessary. Transfer to a serving bowl and set aside.
4.
In a large pot, heat 2 inches of oil to 350°F (177°C). Run a butter knife or thin spatula around the edges of the baking dish, then flip it over onto a cutting board to release the solidified chickpea base. Cut chickpea base in half lengthwise, then cut the halves crosswise into thin, fry-like slices. Working in batches, fry slices until golden all over, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to absorb excess oil. Sprinkle with salt while hummus fries are still hot.
5.
Sprinkle hummus fries and spicy tahini sauce with paprika and chopped parsley. Serve immediately.

Vegan Green Bean Casserole Recipe,,"[Photograph: Kristin Donnelly]
The classic green bean casserole gets veganized in this recipe, in which a silky cauliflower purée stands in for the creamy base of the typical mushroom soup. As with most casseroles, you can assemble this one a day ahead and bake just before serving; fry the onions the same day you plan to serve.","Yield:Serves 6 to 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes","Ingredients
Kosher salt
1 1/2 pounds (680g) green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths
1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
1/2 pound (225g) button or cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed
3 cups (710ml) vegetable stock or low-sodium broth, plus more as needed
One (2-pound; 900g) head cauliflower, cored and cut into medium florets (1 1/2 pounds or 680g after prep)
3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (optional)
Freshly ground black pepper
Canola oil or other neutral oil, for frying
1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced into half moons","1.
Fill a large saucepan about halfway with water and bring to a boil. Season generously with salt, then add the green beans and cook until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain the beans and rinse out the saucepan.
2.
In a food processor, pulse the yellow onion and mushrooms until finely chopped, about 15 pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and rinse out food processor bowl.
3.
In the same saucepan used for the green beans, bring vegetable broth to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the cauliflower. Cover and cook until the cauliflower is very tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. (If the broth seems to be steaming from under the lid, reduce the heat to low. You want to cook the cauliflower while retaining as much liquid as possible.)
4.
Transfer the cauliflower and cooking liquid to the rinsed-out food processor bowl and let cool slightly. Purée the cauliflower until very smooth. (You can also purée the cauliflower using a high-powered blender, if you have one, which will give you the best texture. However, you can achieve a smooth purée if you let a food processor run for a solid minute or more and scrape down the sides occasionally.)
5.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Rinse out the saucepan again, then dry well. Add olive oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and onions and season generously with salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms and onions stop releasing water and are tender, about 10 minutes.
6.
Add the cauliflower sauce, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, thyme, and lemon zest (if using) and season with salt and pepper. (Don’t be shy with the salt and pepper!) Stir in the green beans. If the sauce seems too thick, add more broth until you reach a consistency you like. Transfer the green beans and sauce to a 2-quart baking dish.
7.
Bake the casserole until hot and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
8.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat 1/2 inch canola oil until the oil is hot enough that it bubbles when you add a piece of red onion. Add half of the sliced red onion and fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Using tongs or a spider, transfer the onions to a paper towel–lined plate. Season generously with salt. Repeat with remaining red onions. When the onions are cool enough to touch, use your hands to fluff them a bit so they crisp up.
9.
Let casserole cool for about 5 minutes, then top with the onions and serve.

Grasshopper Ice Cream Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
This mod '50s dessert deserves to make a comeback, via this updated take. Ditch your grandma's crème de menthe and reach for a splash of Fernet Branca, which gives it a bitter bite and lively herbaceousness. Instead of the traditional melted-marshmallow base, the filling here is made with whole eggs, for a richer, less cloying pie. A topping of cocoa nib fudge adds deep dark-chocolate taste and crunch to contrast with the creamy and cool peppermint filling.","Yield:Serves 8 to 12
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:24 hours","Ingredients
For the Crust:
24 chocolate sandwich cookies (9.7 ounces; 270g) (homemade or store-bought)
2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter (1 ounce; 30g)
2 tablespoons heavy cream (1 ounce; 30g)
1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume
For the Filling:
4 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar (5 1/4 ounces; 150g)
1/4 cup Fernet Branca (2 ounces; 60g); see note
1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract, to taste (see note)
1 to 3 drops green food coloring (optional)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream (12 ounces; 310g)
4 ounces (110g) dark chocolate, melted
For the Fudge Topping:
1 cup sugar (7 ounces; 200g)
1/2 cup cocoa nibs (2 ounces; 60g)
2 tablespoons molasses (1 ounce; 30g), not blackstrap
1/4 cup grapeseed oil or any other neutral oil (1 1/2 ounces; 40g)
1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup heavy cream (4 ounces; 110g), cold
Additional whipped cream and melted chocolate for garnish (optional)","1.
For the Crust: In a food processor, blitz cookies until they are fully crumbled. Drizzle in melted butter and cream and add salt. Pulse to combine. (Alternatively, place cookies in a large zip-top bag and crush with a rolling pin. Transfer crumbs to a mixing bowl and combine with butter, cream, and salt.) Transfer crumb mixture to a deep-dish 9-inch pie plate. Using your hands or the back of a measuring cup, press crumbs evenly along walls and bottom of pie plate. Set aside.
2.
For the Filling: Fill a medium saucepot with at least 1 1/2 inches water and bring to a simmer. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together eggs, sugar, Fernet Branca, and salt. Place bowl over pot of simmering water. Stirring constantly with a flexible rubber spatula, heat egg mixture until it reaches 165°F (74°C), about 10 minutes.
3.
Remove bowl from heat and place on stand mixer with whip attachment. Whip egg mixture on high until it becomes thick and pale and doubles in volume, about 10 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add peppermint extract and food coloring (if using). Mix to combine and transfer egg mixture to a wide bowl.
4.
In stand mixer bowl (no need to wash it), whip cream until it reaches soft peaks. Gently fold whipped cream into egg mixture. Using a fork, drizzle streaks of melted chocolate over the entire surface of the mint mousse. Set bowl of mousse in refrigerator until chocolate hardens, about 5 minutes. Using a flexible rubber spatula, crack chocolate streaks into 1-inch pieces and fold into mousse. Repeat the chocolate-drizzling and folding procedure until no more chocolate remains. Pour mint mousse into prepared cookie crust and freeze for at least 6 hours, and preferably overnight.
5.
For the Fudge Topping: Line a rimmed baking sheet with a Silpat or well-greased piece of aluminum foil. In a 1-quart saucepot, combine sugar with 1/4 cup water. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat, about 4 minutes. Remove lid and cook sugar syrup until it becomes a deep golden brown. Remove from heat. Add cocoa nibs and stir to combine. Carefully pour caramel onto lined baking sheet and allow to fully set and cool, about 1 hour.
6.
With a rolling pin, crack caramel into 2- to 3-inch pieces. Transfer pieces to a food processor and pulse until caramel is mostly finely ground. Add molasses, oil, salt, and vanilla and process until combined. With food processor running, slowly drizzle in chilled cream, stopping to scrape down bowl's sides if needed. Transfer mixture to a piping bag fitted with a plain #17 tip and chill for at least 1 hour before piping.
7.
To Finish: Remove pie from freezer and garnish the top with fudge in a crisscross pattern. Fill a piping bag fitted with a #32 open star tip with whipped cream and pipe along the border. Drizzle the edges with melted chocolate, if desired. Using a knife dipped in hot water, cut pie into 8 to 12 slices and serve with extra fudge on the side.

Creamy Brussels Sprouts Gratin With Blue Cheese Recipe,,"[Photograph: Blake Royer]
When cooking brussels sprouts, my go-to method is caramelizing them as much as possible. Often, I just start them cut-side down in a cast iron skillet until golden, then finish them in a blazing hot oven with a splash of balsamic vinegar. But that's not the only way to dress them up.
Who can argue with Nigel Slater's brussels sprouts technique, especially when he suggests a recipe as decadent as this one? Robed in a sauce of cream, blue cheese, and whole grain mustard, they're cooked down gratin-style under a blanket of Parmesan. It's the richest thing I've eaten in ages, and it took all my will to not slurp it up with a straw.
To make this into a main dish, toss it with cooked pasta.

Hazelnut Cookies With Milk Chocolate Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Homemade hazelnut butter gives these soft and chewy cookies a rich flavor, one that's best supported by a light drizzle of milk chocolate. If you'd rather not temper the chocolate, give it a rough chop and stir it into the finished dough instead; the results will be a little more homey in appearance, but they'll taste just as fancy.","Yield:makes thirty-two 3 1/2-inch cookies
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 4.4","Ingredients
7 ounces whole hazelnuts, toasted and skinned (about 1 1/3 cups; 200g)
4 ounces unsalted butter, pliable but cool, about 60°F (8 tablespoons; 115g)
10 1/2 ounces plain or lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/2 cups, 295g)
1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge
9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)
6 ounces dark or milk chocolate, not chips (about 1 heaping cup, roughly chopped; 85g), tempered","1.
Make the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). In the bowl of a food processor, grind hazelnuts to form a smooth and creamy paste. Combine hazelnut paste, butter, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating only until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour all at once, and mix to form a stiff dough. If not tempering the chocolate, fold chopped pieces into the dough now.
2.
Portion the Dough: Divide in 2-tablespoon portions and round each one into a smooth ball. (Portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70°F or 21°C, and proceed as directed.)
3.
To Bake: Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges but steamy in the middle, about 12 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes.
4.
To Finish the Cookies: When the cookies have cooled to room temperature, drizzle with tempered milk chocolate. Once the chocolate has set, transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax or parchment paper between each layer and store up to a week at room temperature.

Winter Apple and Dried-Fruit Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
As opposed to other baked goods, you rarely see pies made with dried fruit. This pie proves that shouldn't be the case.
The combination of fresh apples and dried fruits creates a filling that's a combination of crisp, soft, and chewy, and is a nice departure from the more monotone texture of traditional apple pie. Best of all, the dried fruit absorbs some of the apple juices, helping to dry out the filling naturally and give the re-hydrated fruit maximum flavor.
The combination of dried fruits can be tailored to your taste, but we like a mix of dried cherries, chopped dried figs, dried cranberries, currants, raisins. Places that have bulk dried fruit, like health food stores or Whole Foods, will be your best bet for economy.","Yield:serves 8

One recipe Easy Pie Dough, one half shaped and chilled in a pie plate, the other rolled out flat and chilled on a floured sheet pan
8 medium Golden Delicious, Braeburn, or other baking apples peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
10 ounces dried fruits (a combination of dried cherries, chopped dried figs, dried cranberries, currants, raisins)
1 tablespoon zest from one lemon
6 ounces granulated sugar (adjust to taste, depending on sweetness of apples and dried fruits)
1/2 ounce cornstarch
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 pinch grated nutmeg
1 whole egg, lightly beaten
Sanding sugar for top (optional)","1.
Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat the oven to 425°F. Place apple slices in a large bowl or pot. Pour boiling water directly over top. Cover and set aside at room temperature for ten minutes. Drain apples well and transfer to a large bowl. Allow to cool for 20 minutes, tossing occasionally. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with the dried fruit. Whisk together the sugar, starch, and spices and add to the apple mixture. Toss until well-coated. pour the contents of the bowl into the chilled pie shell. Cover with the top crust, either by cutting the chilled top crust into strips and weaving a lattice, or by covering the pie with the whole crust. Crimp the sides and chill the pie for 15 - 20 minutes.
2.
When ready to bake, brush the top with egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. If you've covered the pie with a whole top crust, cut slits in the top. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 375°F and bake for additional time: for non-lattice, approximately 40 minutes, for lattice, approximately 50, both rotating halfway through. The crust should be golden brown and the filling should be bubbling. If parts of the crust start to look too dark, cover the darker parts with small patches of foil to protect them from the heat.

Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. You may make this pie in advance, but it is best served the same day that you bake it.

","[Photographs and original illustrations: Cakespy]
This baked pudding is really more like a cake. Rich in diced figs and spices, it gives a hint of fruitcakey-ness, but with a flavor that is far superior. The figs give it a mellow, almost honey-like sweetness, and keep it just moist enough to be slightly sticky, but not so sticky that it sticks to your teeth.
I took some liberties with the traditional recipe, substituting crushed graham cracker crumbs for bread crumbs, and going without a water bath. Forgoing the water bath suggested in the recipe I adapted was actually a mistake, but the pudding came out moist, cake-like, and uncracked, so I decided to stick with it here.
Technically, this figgy pudding doesn't need garnish, but I found that it was highly pleasant when paired with a simple confectioners' sugar glaze, and a sprinkling of crystallized mint made it festive and pretty.
Recipe adapted from Chef James Thomas","Yield:Serves 12
Active time: 30 minutes minutes
Total time:2 hours, plus cooling time
Rated: 5","Ingredients
1 1/2 cups (about 6.375 ounces) all purpose flour
1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
16 ounces dried dark figs, finely chopped
1 3/4 cups (14 ounces) whole milk
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter
1 1/2 cups (about 4.5 ounces) graham cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel
For the glaze (optional)
1 1/2 cups (about 6 ounces) confectioners' sugar
Up to 3 tablespoons heavy cream or eggnog
Sprinkles, berries, or candied mint to garnish","1.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease a bundt pan.
2.
In a medium bowl mix flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt.
3.
In a a medium saucepan, heat the figs and milk over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a simmer. Do not let the mixture come to a boil, but reduce the heat lightly and let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the figs are completely soft and fattened from the milk. This mixture will be rather thick.
4.
In a separate large bowl, whisk the eggs vigorously by hand for one minute. Stir in the melted butter, graham cracker crumbs, and lemon peel. Once combined, stir in the warm fig and milk mixture. Now, add the flour mixture. Stir only until completely combined. This will be a thick batter.
5.
Gently spoon the batter into the greased pan. Place a sheet of aluminum foil on top. Bake for 90 minutes, and then remove the foil. If the pudding has become firm to the touch and begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, you're done. If not yet, continue baking until it has reached that point.
6.
Run a sharp knife around the edges of the pan to help loosen the pudding. Let cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate. It should come out rather easily.
7.
If desired, garnish with a confectioners' sugar glaze made by whisking together confectioners' sugar and only as much cream or eggnog as desired to give it a thick but pourable consistency. Top with sprinkles, berries, or follow my example and use crystallized mint.
8.
Serve by cutting into wedges. Keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.

This riff on the French 75, from bartender Jeffrey Knott of Seville Quarter in Pensacola, Florida, expertly balances tart and sweet, with a pleasantly bitter grapefruit edge. The key is using Stiegl-Radler Grapefruit from Austria in place of sparkling wine: It's a lightly alcoholic mix of beer and grapefruit soda that adds a refreshing citrusy flavor to this cocktail's mix of tangy lemon and herbal gin.","Yield:Makes 2 cocktails

Silky-Smooth Vegetarian Pâté With Roasted Cauliflower and Pecans Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Most vegetarian pâtés rely on mushrooms for their meaty texture and flavor, but this one turns to a surprise ingredient—roasted cauliflower—for similar effect. Pecans help thicken the purée to a pâté-like consistency, while splashes of brandy and soy sauce add even more savory depth.","Yield:Makes about 4 cups (1L)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes

2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter (see note)
1 large yellow onion (8 ounces; 225g), thinly sliced
4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
Pinch cayenne pepper
1/4 cup (60ml) brandy
1 cup (235ml) heavy cream (see note)
1 sprig thyme
1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce","1.
In a bowl, cover pecans with at least 1 inch water and let soak for 1 hour.
2.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Place cauliflower on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, toss with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast, flipping cauliflower with a thin metal spatula halfway through roasting, until tender and deeply browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total.
3.
In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and cayenne and cook, stirring often, until softened and just starting to turn golden, about 4 minutes. Add brandy and cook until completely evaporated.
4.
Add cauliflower, cream, and thyme. Drain pecans and add to saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then cook, adjusting heat to maintain simmer, until cauliflower has softened and liquid has reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Discard thyme sprig. Add soy sauce.

Using a blender or immersion blender, blend cauliflower and liquid to form a very smooth purée. Season with salt and pepper. To chill rapidly, spread vegetarian pâté in a thin, even layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet (a quarter-sheet size is best for this), then press plastic wrap directly against pâté's surface, pushing out any air. Otherwise, transfer pâté to a heatproof container and press plastic directly against surface. Refrigerate until well chilled. Transfer to a serving vessel and serve with crackers or toasted baguette rounds.

","Loving the flavor and look of Hasselback potatoes, I knew it wouldn't be long before I found myself grilling them again. This time around I went with a sweet potato rather than a russet since they're one of my favorite winter foods.
I kept the process exactly the same: slicing, washing, then jump starting the potato cooking process in the microwave. Then the partial cooked spuds were finished on the grill, where they fanned out and got crisp around the edges, while being soft and smooth on the inside.
While I thoroughly enjoyed my beautiful taters topped with rosemary and garlic, these do come with a warning from my wife who completely disagreed—finding them overly smoky and the garlic to be a conflicting flavor. Both of these issues are easily fixed—cook them in the oven and omit the garlic—but if I were making them for myself again, I wouldn't change a thing.","Yield:serves 4

6 medium cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided

Rinse potato under running water, fanning out to rinse inside of cut slits. Place potatoes on a plate and microwave at high for 4 minutes. Flip potatoes over and microwave again for an additional 4 minutes.

Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Brush potatoes with remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place potatoes on cool side of grill, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.

"Traditional Provençal Tapenade With Capers, Anchovies, and Tuna Recipe",,"A traditional tapenade based on the original 1880 recipe. [Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
Unlike the modern version of tapenade, which features the olive more prominently than the other ingredients, this recipe is based on the original, created by a chef named Meynier at the Marseilles restaurant La Maison Dorée in 1880. It's made with equal parts olive, caper, and briny fish, like anchovies and oil-packed tuna—hence the fact that tapenade takes its name from capers (tapeno in Provençal) and not olives.","Yield:Makes about 1 cup

Little Debbie-Style Christmas Tree Cakes Recipe,,"[Photographs: Sarah Jane Sanders]
This recipe calls for spiced rum, which goes a long way to mimic the chemical cocktail of mystery that flavors the Little Debbie originals. Frangelico works well, too. If you don't consume alcohol, just omit the booze, increase the milk to 8 ounces and add 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice. It'll bring you mighty close.
For those not as obsessed as I am with recreating things down to the last detail, feel free to skip making the glaze and just dip the cakes in chocolate ganache. They'll be a little less fussy to make and extra delicious, but will taste more like a fancy eat-with-a-fork dessert than a lunchbox snack. The recipe for the glaze given here, however, will give you a touchable glaze that you can eat out of hand. If you're a stickler for details, make a double batch of the chocolate glaze and dip the cakes twice for a thick chocolatey coating. Once will get the job done, though the cake may show through in patches.
Making this cake isn't hard at all, but describing the entire process makes it seem more daunting. Put simply: bake a cake. Make buttercream. Sandwich them together. Cut into shapes. Glaze. Put more obnoxiously, well, read on.

1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature
4 1/2 ounces egg yolks (from about 6 eggs)

6 ounces water, divided
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 ounce vanilla extract
1 1/2 ounces cocoa powder (omit for vanilla version)
Sprinkles to garnish","1.
Make and bake the cake layers:
Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two jelly roll style sheet pans with a sheet of parchment.
With a hand or stand mixer, cream together the sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, almond extract, vanilla extract and butter. Cream for about 6 minutes on medium speed, or until light and fluffy. Stop about halfway through to scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula.
While the mixture is creaming, sift the flour through a sieve and set aside.
While still mixing at medium speed, begin adding in the yolks, one at a time. Mix thoroughly after each addition.
Turn the mixer to low speed and, with it still running, add half of the flour. Drizzle in half the milk. Repeat with the remaining flour, milk and rum. Continue mixing only until homogenous.
Shut off the mixer and scrape the bowl down with a spatula and stir, if necessary, to incorporate any lumps of batter around the sides of the bowl.
Divide the batter evenly between the two sheet pans and use an offset spatula to spread the batter into an even layer. Rap the pans against the counter a few times to dislodge any air bubbles.
Bake for five minutes. You'll notice at this time some uneven bubbling occurring in the cakes. Remove the cakes from the oven and shake gently or rap against the counter to deflate the bubbles. Rotate the cake pans and continue baking another five minutes or until uniformly pale-golden and spongy to the touch.
Set aside to cool until needed.
2.
Make the filling:
In a small pot, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar, cornstarch and cocoa. While whisking, drizzle in the hot milk. Return the milk/egg mixture to the pot and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly. Whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and continue mixing one minutes more, to thoroughly cook out the cornstarch.
Use a spatula to transfer the cooked custard to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in the chocolate and salt. Using the paddle attachment, beat on low speed for 10 minutes, or until the mixture and the bowl itself have become cool to the touch.
Once cool, turn the speed up to medium and, with the mixer still running, add the butter one tablespoon at a time, then drizzle in the vanilla. Shut off the mixer and let stand until needed.
3.
Assemble and cut the cakes:
Run a knife around the edges of the cake pans to loosen the cakes. Place a sheet of parchment over both cakes. Next you need to invert both cakes, remove the parchment paper from their bottoms, then re-invert them right-side up.
More detailed explanation: invert one of the cakes onto a cutting board, set the sheet pan aside, and very gently peel away the bottom layer of parchment. Invert the second cake onto the bottom of the now empty sheet pan from the first cake (it's easier to handle the cake when it's on the bottom of the sheet pan, rather than nestled down into the sheet pan and hard to access). Likewise, peel away parchment paper. Now re-invert this second cake to the bottom of its original sheet pan. You now have both cakes right side up, one on a cutting board, one on an upside down sheet pan.
Use a rubber spatula to transfer all of the chocolate buttercream from the bowl to the cake resting on the cutting board. With an offset spatula, spread the buttercream out as evenly as possible, from corner to corner. Hold the sheet pan with the second cake over the buttercreamed cake; gently slide the cake off the sheet pan and on to the buttercream. Press the cake down gently with your fingers to ensure the layers are even.
Wrap the cutting board in plastic and freeze for one hour. Freezing the cake solidifies the buttercream and makes cutting it into tidy shapes much easier.
To cut into Christmas trees, remove the cake from the freezer and cut lengthwise into two long strips, 4"" wide. There will be a 2"" strip leftover for snacking.
Cut each strip with a chef's knife in a zig zag pattern to create a series of isosceles triangles, 3"" wide at the base.
Arrange all of the triangles to their narrowest end points away from you. This is the basic shape of the tree. Trim away a small notch on either side of the base of the triangle to leave behind a 1"" wide trunk shape.
Cover the trees loosely in plastic and freeze or refrigerate until needed.
4.
Prepare the glaze:
In the smallest pot you have that will accommodate the ingredients, combine the powdered sugar, half the water, salt and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. Set the pot over medium low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the powdered sugar has dissolved and the mixture just beings to bubble. Remove from heat. Set aside a 1/2 cup of this vanilla glaze.
Now add in the remaining water and cocoa powder (if using) and whisk until combined. Cool to room temperature.
5.
Glaze and decorate the cakes:
Have a sheet pan lined with parchment paper ready.
Remove the cakes from the freezer and drop one straight into the center of the glaze. Use a fork to splash some glaze over the top of the cake. Next, lift the cake up and out of the glaze. Let any excess glaze drip back into the pot. Lightly drag the bottom of the cake/fork against the edge of the pot to minimize dripping and excess glaze. Gently place the cake onto the prepared sheet pan.
Repeat with the remaining cakes. For a thick, dark coating, let the cakes dry for about an hour, then make a second batch of glaze (reserving none of the vanilla) and dip the cakes again. If given only one glaze, the cake will show through the glaze in patches. Whether you dip a second round is entirely up to your sense of perfectionism; one glaze is all it takes for a delicious cake.
Once all of the cakes have been glazed, drizzle with the remaining vanilla glaze (tint the glaze red, if making the vanilla version). If the glaze has become too firm to drizzle, add in a teaspoon of water and stir to thin. Drizzle with a spoon, or with a pastry bag fitted with a small, plain tip. Finally, scatter sprinkles all over.
Place the tray of cakes in a well ventilated and safe location where they may dry, undisturbed by pets or children. Let the cakes stand, uncovered, for about six hours or until the glaze has set. Exactly how long this takes will depend on the air flow and humidity in your home.
Once the glaze has set, the cakes are ready for snacking! (Use a spatula to lift the cakes from the parchment, once free, you can handle them easily.)
The cakes will store, covered, at room temperature for about 2 days, or up to a week in the fridge.

The Dark Knight Cake (Triple Chocolate Layer Cake) Recipe,,"[Photograph: @sstiavetti]
I've dubbed this gorgeously rich, moist cake The Dark Knight, as it's a tall, glowering tower of chocolate intensity. A generous blast of dark roast coffee and a touch of milk makes for a gently bitter tone, while a smidge of cayenne adds mystique without turning up the heat. Packed with dates for extra tenderness, it's nearly impossible to ruin this cake unless you a seriously over bake it, or a) overmix it. Be watchful when baking and mixing, and you're sure to have a masterpiece on your hands.
This recipe calls for a helping of chocolate buttercream and another helping of chocolate ganache. I've linked to these recipes in the ingredients list. Feel free to make the icings the day before and keep them in the refrigerator, allowing them to come fully to room temperature before constructing the finished cake.","Yield:Makes one tall 8-inch cake
Active time: 35 minutes
Total time:2 hours","Ingredients
Butter for greasing
1 3/4 cups dates, pitted and chopped coarsely
3/4 cup hot, brewed dark roast coffee
1/2 cup hot milk
1 cup (about 5 ounces) flour
1/2 cup (about 2 1/2 ounces) unsweetened cocoa poweder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick plus 2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup (about 3 1/2 ounce) sugar
1/4 cup (about 2 ounces) packed brown sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 cups chocolate buttercream icing
2 cups chocolate ganache
3 tablespoons finely ground espresso powder","1.
Set oven rack to the middle and preheat to 350°F. Grease two 8-inch round cake pans.
2.
Set the dates in a bowl and cover with hot coffee and hot milk. Cover and let soak for 10 minutes. Add to a food processor and pulse until smooth.
3.
In a small bowl combine flour, cocoa, cayenne, baking soda, and salt. Stir well.
4.
Add the butter, sugar, and brown sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium-low until light and airy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating each until incorporated. Add vanilla and beat until well mixed.
5.
With the mixer on low, add the dry ingredients 1/2 cup at a time, mixing after each addition just until incorporated. Add the dates to the batter and gently fold with a spatula, stopping as soon as the batter is uniform in texture. Scoop the batter into the prepared baking pans and bake for 40 minutes, or until the sides pull away from the pans. Allow to cool for 20 minutes in the pans, then carefully turn out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
6.
Slice each cake horizontally into two layers of equal thickness. Set the bottom layer of the cake aside; that will be the top of your stacked cake. Scoop 1/2 cup of chocolate buttercream onto one layer of cake and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of espresso powder and set the next layer on top. Scoop another 1/2 cup of icing onto the layer and sprinkle with another 1 tablespoon of espresso powder. Repeat with the third layer and top the cake with the reserved bottom layer of cake. Crumb coat the sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream and set the cake to chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
7.
Heat the ganache just to the point that it flows well but is not too thin or watery. Set the chilled cake on a cooling rack placed into a baking sheet and carefully pour the ganache over the entire cake, coating it in one smooth layer. Set the cake back in the refrigerator to chill for another 15 minutes to set the ganache. Serve at room temperature.

Porchetta-Flavored Spatchcocked Turkey Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
The woodsy herb, fennel, and garlic flavors in a classic Italian porchetta are an absolutely natural match for turkey, which is why we stuff them under the skin in this easy recipe. It's such a great pairing, we're surprised the Pilgrims didn't think of it first.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:2 hours

3 large onions, roughly chopped (about 1 1/2 quarts; 1 1/2 pounds; 680g), divided
3 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 quart; 12 ounces; 340g), divided
4 ribs celery, roughly chopped (about 1 quart; 12 ounces; 340g), divided
12 thyme sprigs, divided
1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns (1/4 ounce; 6g)
1 tablespoon fennel seed (1/4 ounce; 8g)
1 teaspoon (2g) red pepper flakes
4 medium cloves garlic (3/4 ounce; 20g)
1/2 cup fresh sage leaves (1/2 ounce; 15g)
1 whole turkey (12 to 14 pounds total; 5.5 to 6.3kg), butterflied according to these instructions, backbone, neck, and giblets reserved
2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 quarts (1.4L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock
2 bay leaves","1.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Scatter two-thirds of onions, carrots, celery, and thyme sprigs across pan. Place a wire rack directly on top of vegetables.
2.
Using a food processor or mortar and pestle, combine peppercorns, fennel seed, red pepper flakes, garlic, and sage leaves and process or crush until a rough paste is formed, scraping down sides as needed.
3.
Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil all over turkey, then season liberally on all surfaces with salt and black pepper. (If using a brined, salted, or kosher turkey, omit salting step; see note.) Using your hands, carefully separate skin from turkey breast and leg meat while leaving it fully intact. Stuff three-quarters of herb mixture under skin, making sure to spread it around in an even layer that covers as much of the meat as possible; try to avoid leaving large clumps in any one place. Rub remaining herb mixture all over underside of turkey.
4.
Tuck wing tips behind back. Place turkey on top of rack, arranging so that it does not overlap the edges, pressing down on breastbone to flatten breasts slightly.
5.
Transfer turkey to oven and roast, rotating occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into deepest part of breast registers 150°F (66°C) and thighs register at least 165°F (74°C), about 1 hour 20 minutes.
6.
While turkey roasts, make jus. Roughly chop reserved neck, backbone, and giblets. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a 3-quart saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add chopped turkey parts and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onions, carrots, and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and brown in spots, about 5 minutes longer. Add chicken stock, remaining thyme sprigs, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer. Simmer until reduced by half, about 40 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a 2-quart liquid measuring cup and discard solids. Skim off any fat from surface of broth. Season jus to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm.
7.
When turkey is cooked, remove from oven and transfer rack to a new baking sheet. Allow to rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving. Carefully pour any collected juices from pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Skim off excess fat and discard. Whisk juices into jus.

The Ultimate Gluten-Free Angel Food Cake Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
I love gluten-free baking, but gluten-free angel food cake is probably my favorite recipe of them all. It's phenomenally light and fluffy, perhaps even more so than the original, thanks to a blend of gluten-free flours that offers a more delicate balance of starch and protein than unbleached cake flour. The recipe itself couldn't be easier: Just throw some cold egg whites and sugar into a bowl, whip 'em up, and stop before they're stiff. For more information, and photos of vital steps along the way, check out my summary of the technique here.","Yield:Makes one 10-inch tube cake
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:3 hours
Rated: 3.8571428571429","Ingredients
2 ounces tapioca flour or arrowroot starch (about 1/2 cup; 56g)
1 1/2 ounces white rice flour (about 1/3 cup; 42g)
1 1/2 ounces cornstarch (about 1/3 cup; 42g)
1 ounce coconut flour (about 1/4 cup; 28g)
1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder
15 ounces cold egg whites (about 2 cups; 425g), from 12 large eggs
15 ounces granulated sugar (about 2 cups; 425g)
1 tablespoon (15ml) vanilla extract
1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 tablespoons; 30ml), from 1 small lemon
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight","1.
Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350°F. Sift tapioca flour or arrowroot starch, white rice flour, cornstarch, coconut flour, and baking powder into a large bowl. Whisk together until homogeneous, then sift mixture one more time to ensure total uniformity prior to mixing.
2.
Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low to loosen, about 1 minute, then increase to medium-low (4 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes; the whites will be dense and dark.
3.
With the mixer still running, add lemon juice and salt. Immediately increase to medium (6 on a KitchenAid) and whip 3 minutes more; the meringue will be thin but foamy. Increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid) and continue whipping until the meringue is glossy white and thick enough that you can see the pattern left by the wire whisk. This can take between 2 and 4 minutes, depending on the freshness of the whites and the horsepower of your mixer. When meringue is ready, it should be soft enough to run off the wires when the whisk attachment is removed, but thick enough to mound up on itself like soft-serve in the bowl.
4.
Sprinkle flour blend on top and stir with a flexible spatula to roughly combine. Switch to a folding motion, scraping from the bottom up and folding through the center, until no pockets of flour remain. Scrape the batter into a 10-inch aluminum tube pan (do not butter or grease pan); if you notice any small pockets of unincorporated flour, simply pause to mix them in. Bake until the cake is puffed, golden blond, and firm to the touch, about 45 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 206°F.
5.
Invert pan onto its stilts, over the neck of a wine bottle, or onto a trio of cans (see note) and cool upside down until absolutely no trace of warmth remains, at least 2 hours. Slide an offset spatula around the sides of cake to loosen, remove the insert, and slide spatula under the bottom as well. Flip onto a serving plate, pulling gently on the sides of cake to release it from the center tube. To serve, cut with a chef's knife, using a gentle sawing motion and only the slightest downward pressure. In an airtight container, leftovers will keep up to a week at room temperature.

Brown Butter and Sage Sweet Potato Casserole Recipe,,"[Photographs: Ryan Jones]
I can not possibly put down enough words of praise of this dish. I won't even try. Instead, I will say this: it is the best thing I have ever made. (And I have made a whole lot of stuff!)
How you prepare the sweet potatoes will depend on available oven/stove space and personal preference. Below you'll find directions for steaming them (if oven space is an issue on Thanksgiving) or if you're lucky enough to have ample room in the oven, simply toss the sweet potatoes with butter, sage, and maple syrup. Bake at 350° until tender. Then proceed with the final step.
The brown butter sage marshmallows won't hold up in the oven like normal marshmallows, so don't stash the marshmallow-topped casserole in the oven to keep warm. Once you've added the marshmallows, you'll have to brown and serve immediately.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:24 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
Brown Butter Sage Marshmallows
3/4 ounce gelatin
4 ounces water
1/4 ounce fresh sage
4 ounces water
5 ounces corn syrup
14 ounces sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 ounces unsalted butter (or 3 ounces brown butter)
powdered sugar for dusting
Sweet Potato Casserole:
8 large sweet potatoes
2 ounces unsalted butter
1 ounce maple syrup
1/4 ounces fresh sage, roughly chopped
salt and pepper to taste","1.
At least one day in advance, make the marshmallows:
Prepare an 8"" square pan (or a similarly sized pan) by greasing it lightly with pan spray. In the bottom of a stand-mixer bowl, combine the gelatin and water. Whisk with a fork to break up any lumps of gelatin. Set aside.
With a chef's knife, chop the sage as finely as possible. If the sage pieces are very large at all, they will wrap themselves around the whisk attachment during mixing, clump together, and not incorporating into the marshmallow. (Alternately, combine the sage and sugar in a food processor and pulse until the sage has completely ground into the sugar. This also gives the marshmallows a pale green hue.)
In a medium pot, combine the sage, water, corn syrup and sugar. Set over medium heat. Using a heat resistant spatula, stir until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture begins to bubble. Stop stirring. Cook the sugar syrup until a candy thermometer registers 240°. Remove the pot from the heat and cool to 210°. Stir occasionally as the mixture cools to ensure an accurate temperature reading. If the mixture does not cool to 210° before proceeding, the gelatin will not set properly.
While the marshmallow base is cooling, prepare the brown butter. Melt the butter in a small skillet or sauce pan over low heat. Turn the heat to medium and cook until the butter begins to bubble. Continue cooking until it turns a toasty brown. Remove from heat and set aside until needed.
Once the marshmallow mixture has cooled to 210°, pour the syrup into the bowl containing the prepared gelatin. Fit the stand mixer with a whisk attachment and whip on medium speed. Add in the salt. Continue whipping until the mixture has doubled in volume.
Turn the mixer speed to medium low and drizzle in the brown butter, one tablespoonful at a time. If you add the butter too fast, it won't incorporate and the marshmallow mixture may be sufficiently greased to fly right out of the bowl. Please go slowly. Use a spatula to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pan to add those too.
Once the butter has incorporated, shut off the mixer. Use a rubber spatula to transfer the marshmallows to the prepared pan. Rap the pan against the counter once or twice to dislodge any air bubbles and to level the mixture.
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.
2.
Cut the marshmallows:
Prepare a cutting board by dusting it with powdered sugar.
After removing the marshmallows from the fridge, unwrap and dust the surface with powdered sugar. Use your fingers to pull out the giant marshmallow; transfer to the cutting board. Dust the marshmallow all over in powdered sugar so no sticky surfaces remain.
With a chef's knife, cut the marshmallows into 64 1"" cubes, or whatever size and shape you prefer.
Place the cut marshmallows in a large bowl and dust generously with powdered sugar. Use your hands to toss the marshmallows, ensuring all surfaces have been coated with powdered sugar and none are sticking together.
Transfer the dusted marshmallows to an airtight container. Store at room temperature for about two weeks, or indefinitely in the fridge or freezer.
3.
Prepare the casserole:
With a vegetable peeler, peel the sweet potatoes. Use a chef's knife to cut the potatoes into uniformly sized chunks.
Put the sweet potatoes in a steam basket, or improvise one by setting a metal colander into a large pot and adding about 1” of water. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt, and cover. Bring the water to a boil (leaving the lid on the entire time), then reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer.
Check the water level periodically, adding more as necessary. After 10 minutes, test the sweet potatoes with a toothpick or skewer to see if they’re tender. If so, shut off the heat; otherwise, continue steaming (adding more water as needed) until they’re very tender.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small skillet along with the sage. Brown as before. Shut off the heat and stir in the maple syrup.
Transfer the sweet potatoes to an oven safe dish. Pour the maple butter over and toss gently to coat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with foil and set aside until ready to finish.
4.
To finish the casserole:
Set the oven to broil.
Uncover the sweet potatoes. Top generously with sage marshmallows. Place in the casserole on the top or middle oven rack (about 4"" from the heating element) and broil until the marshmallows have turned a deep, foxy brown. Keep a close eye on them; they can go from toasty to burned very quickly.
Serve immediately.

"Roasted Squash with Rajas, Cumin, and Crema Recipe",,"I love pumpkin and winter squash, but after having it roasted or mashed a few times I start looking for new flavors to branch out. Cumin seeds, both roasted with the squash and tossed in right before serving, bring out its earthy, subtly spicy notes. Strips of roasted poblano chiles (rajas) add caramelized flavors and a bright spiciness to give both depth and contrast. A drizzle of crema cuts some of the heat.
Crema is Mexican cultured cream, typically thinner than American sour cream. You can drizzle it off a spoon and more easily use it to coat other ingredients. Though less sour, it has a buttermilk twang I find addictive. If you can't find any, it's dead simple to make. Carefully heat a cup of cream in a jar (use a water bath or a microwave) till it feels just hot to the touch, then stir in a tablespoon of buttermilk and cover tightly. Let it sit somewhere warm for a day and you've got crema that will keep in the fridge for weeks. Or just use regular sour cream—it'll still be delicious.
This will be gracing my table all through fall and winter, but to me this is perfect Thanksgiving food. It's based on simple ingredients, is best served family style, and the leftovers taste delicious. Yes, it's got some heat, but how much is up to you, and that jolt may be just the thing to wake you up between bites of stuffing.","Yield:6 as a side

Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 425°F. In large bowl, toss squash with oil, half of cumin seeds, and heavy pinch of salt until thoroughly coated. Spread out in single layer on two rimmed baking sheets. Roast until squash gives a paring knife no resistance and is browned on one or two sides, about 35 minutes, flipping and testing for doneness every 15 minutes. Set aside in large mixing bowl, cover and keep warm.
2.
Meanwhile, roast poblanos on directly over flame of gas stovetop on medium-low heat, or under broiler. Let skin completely blister and blacken (some ash is okay) before turning until chilis are blackened all around. When chiles have softened and their skin is completely black, set aside and cover with plastic wrap for 10 minutes.
3.
Remove plastic wrap and scrape skin off with paring knife. Slice open chilis and remove central core and seeds. If you want milder chilis, scrape off inner membrane. Slice chilis into thin strips and add to squash. (Note: rajas can be made up to several days ahead.)
4.
Toast remaining cumin seeds in small skillet over high heat until just fragrant about 15 seconds, then add to squash and rajas. Toss everything until well combined. Season with salt. Serve immediately, passing crema at table.

Peeled zest of 6 lemons plus 1 1/3 cups juice from a total of about 10 lemons
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
2 quarts (1/2 gallon) whole milk
1 3/4 cups turbinado simple syrup (see note)
2 cups cognac, such as Pierre Ferrand 1840
1 quart demerara rum, such as El Dorado Five-Year
Garnish: freshly grated nutmeg","1.
Place peeled zest in a non-reactive bowl or container. Add superfine sugar and muddle until the sugar starts to pull out the essential oil in the peels, about 5 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. After it sits, the peels will shrivel and the oils and sugar will combine into a fragrant syrup, called the oleo-saccharum.
2.
Heat milk in a large saucepan, stirring constantly, until steaming but not boiling. Off heat, add the oleo-saccharum (with the zest), lemon juice, simple syrup, cognac, and rum. Stir vigorously until the curds and whey have separated. Strain mixture though a fine mesh strainer to remove curds and zest. Add more syrup or dilute with water to adjust sweetness. Serve warm or cold, topped with freshly grated nutmeg.

Dark Chocolate Cashew Sea Salt Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Carrie Vasios Mullins]
I rarely see cashews in traditional American bakeries. This starchy, tropical nut defers to peanuts, pecans, and walnuts in the canon of old school American sweets. But like the macadamia and the pistachio, I think it's time that cashews got another look.
What I like about cashews is their mild flavor. You can add them to a dish without overwhelming it with nuttiness, though on the flip side, that means it can require a flavor booster (like salt) to highlight its taste. The texture is also something to consider with the cashew—they're softer, almost creamier, than many other nuts, meaning you don't have to disrupt a dish's texture when you add them in.
These cookies take advantage of both of those cashewian properties. They add a subtle nutty flavor while still letting the slightly bitter dark chocolate be the star. They add chew to the already chewy cookies as opposed to breaking up the texture with a hard crunch. Just don't forget the flakey sea salt— it ties together the components and makes these cookies more than the sum of their parts.
There are just enough cashews to add texture without interfering with the overall chewy nature of the cookie
You can substitute other nuts for the cashews, but I wouldn't. Cashews have a mildly nutty flavor that adds depth to the cookies while still letting the dark chocolate reign. Salt helps highlight the flavors.
This recipe is scaled to produce just 12 cookies, for those days when you're not feeding a crowd
Recipe is adapted from Cooks Illustrated","Yield:Makes about 1 dozen cookies

Spring rolls are great, and I love the flavors of bánh mì, so why not stick 'em together? These rolls are stuffed with pickled carrots and daikon radish, cucumber, jalapeño, and cilantro (you can, of course, add whatever other filling you'd like. Tofu or shiitake mushrooms would be nice). The sauce is made with a mixture of homemade vegan mayonnaise and spicy chili-garlic sauce (yes, you can use Sriracha). Creamy, spicy, crispy, tangy, and a little greasy, they hit all the notes you want in a game time snack.
Note: This recipe calls for the smaller 5"" by 5"" spring roll wrappers which can be found in the frozen section of most East Asian markets. Egg roll wrappers can be substituted. If only larger wrappers are available, make larger rolls, or cut wrappers down to size.","Yield:Makes 30 to 40 small spring rolls
Active time: 1 1/2 hours
Total time:1 1/2 hours","Ingredients
1 large carrot, cut into 3-inch matchsticks 1/8 inch thick (about 2 cups)
1 small daikon radish, cut into 3-inch matchsticks 1/8 inch thick (about 2 cups)
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons white distilled or rice wine vinegar
30 to 40 five-inch frozen spring roll wrappers, thawed
1 large cucumber, peeled, cored, and cut into 3-inch sticks about 1/4-inch wide (30 to 40 sticks total)
2 whole jalapeño peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into 3-inch sticks about 1/8th inch thick (30 to 40 sticks total)
1 bunch cilantro, leaves and thin stems only
For the Dipping Sauce:
1/2 cup Vegan Mayonnaise
2 tablespoons chili garlic sauce such as sambal oelek or sriracha, or more to taste
1 teaspoon juice from 1 lime
2 tablespoons finely minced cilantro leaves
2 quarts vegetable oil","1.
Combine carrots, daikon, sugar, salt, and vinegar in a large bowl and massage with hands until vegetables are softened and salt and sugar are dissolved. Set aside for 15 minutes at room temperature.
2.
Lay one spring roll wrapper down with a corner pointed towards you. Cover remaining wrappers with plastic or a moist clean kitchen towel. Add a half dozen carrot/daikon sticks, 1 cucumber stick, 1 jalapeño stick, and a few leaves/stems of cilantro in a bundle in the lower third of the wrapper, keeping it in a nice, tight row. Roll from the bottom corner towards the top, keeping everything nice and tight. Roll until nearly half way up, then stop.
3.
The next step is to fold the left and right corners towards the center. Start by first pressing in on the edges of the filling with your fingertips to make sure it's packed nice and tight. Fold the corners towards the center, again keeping everything tight. Moistening the edges of the wrapper with a bit of water will help it stick to itself and keep its shape.You want the bottom edge to form a 90° angle with the new edge you've just created by folding over the corner.
4.
After both corners have been folded in, continue rolling towards the top of the paper. Moisten the top corner of the wrapper with a bit of water and continue rolling until the entire package is sealed. Repeat with remaining rolls until all the filling is used up. Finished rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months in a sealed container. If freezing, fry directly from the freezer, adding 1 minute to cook time.
5.
To Make The Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside. Sauce will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
6.
To Serve: Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 325°F as registered on an instant read thermometer. Add 10 to 15 rolls and cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with spicy mayonnaise.

Filled with Champagne buttercream and decorated with gold chocolate shards and sugar pearls, this cake roll is the pinnacle of festivity. Instead of using ordinary Champagne, I make this cake with Marc de Champagne, a pomace brandy made from Champagne grape skins, seeds, and stalks that pairs beautifully with the cake's creamy buttercream filling and sweet white chocolate ganache coating.
If you can't get your hands on Marc de Champagne, you can also use a Marc de Bourgogne or a barrel-aged grappa made with Chardonnay grapes. Although I'm sure wine connoisseurs will be able to tell the difference, the cheaper grappa has a similar flavor profile.
Why this recipe works:
This cake has a soft, tender crumb, because it's made with with both oil and buttermilk. Beating the eggs for five minutes before adding the other cake ingredients ensures that the cake becomes light and spongy.
Rolling the cake into a tea towel dusted with powdered sugar while it's still hot prevents cracking.
This cake is filled with Swiss buttercream, which you can pasteurize to make it safe. Directions on how to pasteurize the buttercream are included in the recipe.
Notes: To pasteurize the buttercream, you will need a candy thermometer. Also note that this cake must be served at room temperature to experience the velvety smoothness of the buttercream.","Yield:Serves 8 to 12

3.
In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture, one tablespoon at a time, mixing continuously until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan and carefully tilt pan to distribute batter in an even layer. Bake for until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean and top of the cake springs back when pressed with fingers, 12 to 15 minutes.
4.
While the cake is in the oven, place a clean, cotton tea towel (preferably one without decorative textures) on counter and sprinkle with powdered sugar, using your hands to rub the sugar into the tea towel.
5.
Once the cake is done, remove from oven and allow to cool for one minute, then immediately turn cake out onto the tea towel, carefully peel off the parchment and roll cake in the tea towel, starting at a short side. Roll slowly and tightly. Place cake roll (wrapped in tea towel) on a wire rack seam-side down until it has cooled completely.
6.
For the Champagne syrup: Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is clear. Remove from heat, transfer to a mug and allow to cool.
Once cool, combine 1/4 cup of syrup with the Marc de Champagne. (Remaining syrup can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for another use.)
7.
For the Champagne Buttercream: In a medium-sized heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg whites and sugar. Place the bowl over a small pan with simmering water, making sure the water doesn't touch the bowl. Keep whisking the mixture until sugar has dissolved. You can easily check whether the sugar has dissolved by rubbing a bit of the mixture between your fingers; the mixture shouldn't feel grainy.
8.
If you're not worried about salmonella, you can take the mixture off the heat at this point. If you want to pasteurize the meringue, keep whisking until the mixture reaches a temperature of 71°C/160°F using a candy thermometer. Once the meringue reaches the desired temperature, take it off the heat. Using a hand held or a stand mixer, beat the warm mixture until the meringue holds stiff peaks and the bottom of the bowl feels cool to the touch.
9.
Add butter one cube at a time, beating well with the electric mixer after each addition. The mixture may start to look as if it’s separating during this process but don't panic: just keep beating and the buttercream will come together and become smooth. Once the buttercream is smooth and creamy, add Marc de Champagne and again mix until smooth.
10.
Once the cake has cooled to room temperature, carefully unroll the cake roll and place it on a clean work surface. Allow the tightest rolled end to curl back in to prevent the cake from cracking. Should it crack a little, that’s fine; you won’t see it after you roll it back up.
11.
Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the cake roll with the champagne syrup. Frost with the Champagne buttercream, leaving a one-inch border uncovered at the uncurled end. Reroll cake starting from the curled end.
12.
For the White Chocolate Ganache: Combine cream and white chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate has melted and the ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to body temperature.
13.
Once cool, beat ganache with a mixer until it lightens in color. It should be thick, but easily spreadable. Frost the cake roll with the white chocolate ganache, using the back of a spoon to create a bark-like pattern. Allow excess ganache to drip down onto the cookie sheet. Place cake (wire rack and all) in the fridge until ganache has set.
14.
For the White Chocolate Shards: place a cookie sheet in the freezer. Carefully melt the chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler, stirring occasionally. Once the chocolate has melted, remove the cookie sheet from the freezer and line it with baking parchment. Pour the melted white chocolate onto the sheet. Using the back of a spoon, spread the chocolate in an even layer. Allow chocolate to set completely in the refrigerator.
15.
Once set, use a sharp knife to cut the chocolate into shards. Using a clean, dry paintbrush, brush the chocolate shards with the gold luster dust.
16.
To Assemble: Once the ganache has set, remove the cake from the fridge. Heat a serrated knife by placing the knife in a tall container filled with hot water. Dry the knife and trim ½ inch off both ends of the cake, wiping the knife clean between cuts.
17.
Run a sharp knife along the perimeter of the cake to loosen the ganache from the wire rack. Carefully transfer the cake to a serving plate or cake stand using a large spatula. Decorate with the chocolate shards and sugar pearls as desired.
18.
Allow the cake to come to room temperate before serving. This should take 2-3 hours. Undecorated cake (finished cake roll without the chocolate shards and sugar pearls) can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. Decorate just before serving.

Swiss Chard and Pasta Soup Recipe,,"[Photograph: Nick Kindelsperger]
I've been sautéing a lot of pasta recently. And the more I do it, the more addicted I become to the flavor. Much like cooking rice before adding water, sautéing brings out some incredible toasted aromas in the pasta.
The method is also a great way to spruce up very simple soups, including this one from Diana Kennedy's Oaxaca al Gusto. This is pure comfort food, but it's also one with a surprising amount of depth.
Now, I know the chicken livers are going to scare off a lot of people. That's understandable—and part of me thinks it would still work without them. But I like the little bit of funk they add. You'd never pick out the flavor, but they add a meaty backbone to each sip. Still, if it bothers you that much, just leave them out. The soup is flavorful enough to get by just fine.","Yield:serves 4
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour","Ingredients
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
7 ounces orzo pasta (or pasta de pluma)
1 small white onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
12 ounces canned tomatoes, finely chopped
8 cups chicken broth
4 large chicken livers, cleaned and chopped
4 cups coarsely chopped Swiss chard
1 small bunch Italian parsley
Salt
Croutons","1.
Pour the oil into a large pot set over medium heat. When warm, add the pasta and cook, stirring often, until it is lightly browned, three to five minutes. Remove the pasta and drain in a strainer. Remove all but one tablespoon of the oil.
2.
With the heat still on medium, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about five minutes. Add the tomatoes, stir well, and cook until the liquid has reduced, about 10 minutes.
3.
Meanwhile, pour one cup of the broth into a small saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. Add the chopped livers, and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the livers are tender but still a little pink inside, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside when done.
4.
When the tomatoes have reduced, pour in the remaining broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the Swiss chard, the parsley, and the pasta. Reduce the heat to medium, season to taste with salt, and cook until the the pasta is cooked and the chard is tender, about 15 minutes. Add the livers and cook for an additional five minutes.
5.
When done, discard the parsley. Ladle the soup into bowls, season to taste with salt, and garnish with croutons.

Make-Ahead Fig and Cinnamon Punch Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
This warmly spiced rum punch, adapted from bartender A. Minetta Gould of Saint Ellie in Denver, balances the bitterness of black tea with the nutty sweetness of dried figs and Bual Madeira, which is a rich-but-still-refreshing fortified wine that gets its toasty flavor from long, slow exposure to oxygen in wooden barrels that are stored in sub-tropical conditions. Don't forget to make ice at least a day in advance of serving; you'll need a big block or several trays of cubes for the punchbowl, plus regular cubes for each cup.","Yield:Makes about 12 servings
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:55 minutes (can be made in advance and kept refrigerated)
Rated: 5","Ingredients
12 ounces (340g) dried figs (about 35 figs), halved
6 (4-inch) cinnamon sticks
6 black tea bags
1 (750ml) bottle aged rum, such as Plantation Barbados 5-Year
4 1/2 ounces (135ml) Bual Madeira, such as Blandy's
Up to 1/2 ounce maple syrup (0 to 22ml), to taste (optional; see note)
3 lemons, sliced thinly into wheels, for garnish","1.
At least 1 day before you want to serve the punch, make a large ice block by freezing water (filtered if desired) in a cake pan or tupperware container that will fit in your serving vessel. Alternately, make several trays of large ice cubes. In addition, you'll want about 4 standard trays of ice cubes for serving.
2.
In a medium saucepan, combine halved figs, cinnamon sticks, and 4 1/2 cups (1.06L) water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Let simmer 1 minute. Add tea bags, remove pan from heat, and let steep 5 minutes. Discard teabags, then allow cinnamon-fig tea to stand for 45 minutes. Fine strain into a sealable container, pressing on solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to chill, and up to 24 hours.
3.
To Make Punch: In a large bowl, 3-quart pitcher, or other large container, stir together rum, Madeira, and cooled fig tea. Taste, adding optional maple syrup in 1/4-ounce additions until desired sweetness level is reached (you may not need any, depending on the sweetness of your rum and Madeira). The punch can be served right away or refrigerated, well sealed, up to 6 days.

"Seven-Layer Make-Ahead Salad With Chickpeas, Endive, and Yogurt Dressing Recipe",,"[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]
Let's admit it: A seven-layer salad is really just garnished mayonnaise. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's potluck food—not exactly the kind of dish you'd serve at a dinner party or holiday gathering. It's too bad, because the seven-layer salad offers one really serious advantage to the harried home cook: It's meant to be made ahead. You can assemble the whole thing several hours in advance and place it on the table with no need for further dressing or futzing. I decided to take the concept and upgrade it a bit with some more seasonal and holiday meal-appropriate ingredients.","Yield:Serves 6

","Crisp meringue, moist chocolate, and raspberries come together in this ultimate holiday dessert. [Photographs: Nila Jones of The Tough Cookie]
This chocolate meringue cake with whipped cream and fresh raspberries is a surefire crowd pleaser and easy to make. Layers of dense, moist chocolate cake topped with delicate, crispy meringue are sandwiched together with whipped cream and fresh raspberry sauce to make the ultimate holiday dessert.
Why this recipe works:
Completely cooling the chocolate cakes before adding the meringue ensures that the meringue layers bake up gorgeously crisp.
Measuring egg whites by volume instead of by count means your meringue will have the perfect sugar content for crispy meringue layers.
The buttermilk and brown sugar in the chocolate cake layers make for a super moist cake.
Lining the pans with baking parchment allows you to remove the cakes from the pans without damaging the delicate meringue layers.
Note: The raspberry sauce can be made up to three days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator until needed. The cake layers (with or without the baked meringue layers) can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. Make sure to store the cake layers in the sprinform pans if you haven't added the meringue yet. Whipped cream doesn't hold well and will start to lose volume after about eight hours. It is therefore best to assemble this cake the day you intend to serve it. Assembly shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.","Yield:Serves 8 to 10
Active time: 1 hour 10 minutes
Total time:3 hours 35 minutes","Ingredients
For the Chocolate Cakes:
3/4 cup (about 5 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
1/2 cup 1 tablespoon (about 4 ounces) packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup canola or sunflower oil
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules
2 tablespoons boiling water
1/2 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (about 4½ ounces) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon Dutch-processed cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon table salt
For the Raspberry Filling:
4 ounces (just shy of 1 cup) frozen raspberries
5 teaspoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon water
For the Meringue Layers:
2 large egg whites (about 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon total)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Whipped Cream:
3/4 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
To Assemble and Serve:
1 cup fresh raspberries","1.
For the Chocolate Cakes: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 (8-inch) springform pans with baking parchment along the bottom and a collar around the sides (buttering the inside of the pan will help the parchment stick).
2.
Combine the sugars, oil, egg, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on medium-low speed until the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute.
3.
In a medium bowl, dissolve the coffee granules in the water, then stir in the buttermilk. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the wet and dry ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture. Gently stir the ingredients together, using a rubber spatula or a spoon. Once you’ve incorporated most of the dry ingredients, mix briefly on low speed until batter is smooth, about 15 seconds. Don’t overmix, or the cakes will become chewy.

Divide the batter evenly over the prepared pans. Using the back of a spoon, spread the batter evenly in the pans. Bake until a tester inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
5.
Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour. The bottom of the springform pans and the top of the cakes should feel cool to the touch before you proceed with the recipe.
6.
While cakes cool, make the Raspberry Filling: Add frozen raspberries, sugar, and water to a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the berries have started to release their juices. Increase heat to medium-high and allow to come to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook for two minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow the raspberry sauce to cool completely.
7.
Once the cakes are cool, make the Meringue Layers: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 250°F. Carefully clean and dry the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the egg whites and whisk on low speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium high and continue beating until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar in a thin, steady stream. Once you’ve added all the sugar, continue mixing until you can no longer feel any sugar crystals when you rub a bit of the meringue between your fingers and the meringue can hold stiff peaks. Add the vanilla and whisk for an additional minute.
8.
Divide the meringue evenly over the cool cakes. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the meringue in one of the pans and to swirl the meringue in the other pan to form peaks. Bake until dry and crisp but not browned, about 40 minutes. Meringue should sound hollow when tapped gently with a fingernail.
9.
Remove the pans from the oven and allow the cakes to cool for 10 minutes in the pans. After 10 minutes, carefully remove the springform collar and peel away the baking parchment from the sides of the cakes. There is no need to remove the bottom part of the pans yet. Allow the cakes to cool completely.
10.
Once the cake layers have cooled, make the Whipped Cream: Beat cream and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment at high speed until it holds stiff peaks, about 2 minutes.
11.
To Assemble and Serve: Place the cake layer with the flat meringue top onto a cake stand or serving plate, meringue-side down. Peel off the parchment. Fill a pastry bag fitted with an open tip with the whipped cream and pipe a ring of small mounds or dollops around the outer edge of the chocolate cake layer. Spread the remaining cream onto the center of the cake and spread it smoothly all over the top of the cake layer, out to the inner edges of the ring of whipped cream dollops.
12.
Spoon about three tablespoons of the raspberry sauce onto the center of the whipped cream layer. Smooth over the top, out to the inner edges of the whipped cream dollops.
13.
Peel the baking parchment off the second cake layer and arrange it, cake-side down, on top of the bottom layer. Press down lightly. Strain the remaining raspberry sauce through a fine-meshed sieve and discard the raspberry seeds. If you want to serve the cake immediately or within the hour, drizzle the raspberry sauce over the top of the cake and top with a handful of fresh raspberries. If you want to serve the cake later in the day,
refrigerate for up to eight hours in an airtight cake container. Drizzle with raspberry sauce and garnish with fresh raspberries before serving.

"Roasted Beets With Citrus, Feta and Walnuts Recipe",,"Roasted beets pair beautifully with citrus, feta and walnuts in this refreshing winter salad. The only tricky part is peeling the beets because they're messy and turn everything pink, so be sure to wear an apron and use a stain-proof cutting board. You can also wear disposable gloves to protect your hands.
Note: When you toss the citrus segments with the beets, they'll turn a pinkish hue. I think it looks pretty but if you'd rather the beets not bleed into the fruit, you can arrange all of the elements of the salad individually.","Yield:serves 4 to 6
Active time: 20 minutes

6 medium beets (about 1 1/2 pounds)
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 oranges, cut into segments
2 grapefruits, cut into segments
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup crumbled feta
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
3 scallions, finely sliced","1.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Wipe or scrub the beets clean, then trim the stems down to one-inch, leaving the “tails” on.

There is one mid-century dish that does not deserve to be lumped in with the other molds and loaves. It, too, involves processing ingredients until smooth and then molding them into an unnatural shape. It's the cheese ball, and it's actually delicious. But how do we inject some allure into the kitsch? We take away the junk (I'm looking at you, waxy pre-shredded cheddar), we use more flavorful ingredients, and we give people options.

Rhode Island Clam Chowder With White Wine and Bacon Recipe,,"With a light, bright broth, Rhode Island clam chowder is a the perfect choice when you're not in the mood for a heavier creamy chowder. [Photographs: Daniel Gritzer]
Far less popular than creamy New England clam chowder, Rhode Island's dairy-free version deserves a lot more attention. The rich broth is brightened with white wine and loaded with the flavor of clams, chunks of tender potato, and bits of smoky bacon. It may be my new go-to chowder.
Why this recipe works:
This lighter version of clam chowder emphasizes the briny flavor of the clams without the richness of cream or other dairy.
Good white chicken stock creates a broth that's rich and flavorful without overpowering the briny flavor of the clams.
Bacon adds a light smoky flavor.
Note: If you are using homemade chicken stock that already has lots of gelatin (i.e., it should thicken and gel when chilled), you can omit the unflavored gelatin here; if your stock is store-bought, or if it's homemade but watery even when chilled, the unflavored gelatin is an essential ingredient. If using homemade stock, skip step 2.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 35 minutes
Total time:35 minutes plus about 1 hour purging time
Rated: 4","Ingredients
2 pounds live cherrystone or littleneck clams
Kosher salt
3 thick-cut slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 ounces)
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 medium carrots, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 stalks celery, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped (about 2 teaspoons)
1 cup dry white wine
1 quart homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 packets (1/2 ounce) unflavored gelatin (only if using store-bought stock or thin homemade stock; see note)
2 sprigs thyme
1 bay leaf
2 medium Yukon gold potatoes, diced
Minced parsley, for garnish","1.
Scrub clams well under running water and set in a large bowl. Cover with cold water and add enough salt to make water taste salty like the sea. Let clams stand for about 30 minutes, then lift from water and rinse. Inspect soaking water: if there is sand on the bottom of the bowl, discard water, rinse bowl well, and repeat soaking procedure until sand no longer accumulates on bottom of bowl.
2.
Meanwhile, place stock in a large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle gelatin over the top. (See note).
3.
Add bacon to Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bacon is crisp and fat has rendered, about 7 minutes. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.
4.
Add wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until alcohol smell has cooked off, about 4 minutes. Add stock, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf and bring to a simmer.
5.
Add clams. Cover and cook until clams begin to open, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to a large heatproof bowl as they open. If any clams don't open, transfer them to a separate bowl, and attempt to open them by sliding a knife between the shells: any clams that smell good can be added to the others (discard any that smell bad or are filled with mud). Allow clams to cool slightly.
6.
Add potatoes to soup and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, remove clam meat from shells. Discard shells and roughly chop clam meat, collecting all juices that accumulate. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the soup.
7.
Add clam meat back to soup along with any juices and season with salt. Transfer to bowls, garnish with parsley and serve.

"Sweet and Salty Stout Marshmallow Bars With Pretzels, Potato Chips, and Chocolate Recipe",,"Stout, marshmallow, chocolate, and salty snacks make this treat an instant favorite. [Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg]
Rice Krispie treats are one of those desserts that aren't good only to those of us nostalgic for our childhoods—they're actually really delicious. But that doesn't mean we can't upgrade them. To start, we swap out the puffed rice for salty/savory pretzels and potato chips, then infuse the marshmallow binder with a bitter chocolate stout and finish the bars off with a drizzle of melted milk chocolate. Childhood snacks are great. These are even greater.","Yield:Makes 12 bars
Active time: 1 hour

1 1/4 cup double chocolate stout, divided
Nonstick cooking spray
3 packets unflavored gelatin (.75 oz total)
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
3 cups ruffled potato chips, crushed, or more if desired (see note)
3 cups miniature pretzels, crushed, or more if desired (see note)
1/2 cup milk chocolate, chopped","1.
Pour stout into a medium bowl, whisk, then refrigerate until chilled and flat, at least 1 hour and up to overnight.
2.
Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper, allowing the parchment paper ends to overhang the sides, then spray again. Pour 1/2 cup of the flat stout into a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle with the gelatin. Set aside.
3.
In a large (6-quart or more) saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 1/2 cup of the stout. Set over low heat and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
4.
Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil (it will bubble a lot, filling about 3/4 of the saucepan). Continue to boil until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 240°F on an instant-read or candy thermometer. Quickly remove the pot from heat and pour the mixture over the gelatin and stout. Beat the marshmallow mixture with a hand mixer or whisk attachment until it has tripled in size, about 10 minutes. When it is finished, the marshmallow should be very thick and sticky. Beat in vanilla extract and melted butter until combined.
5.
Working in small additions, fold in potato chips and pretzels until the mixture reaches your desired ratio of fillings to marshmallow (see note). Work quickly, since the marshmallow will begin to set as it cools; if it sets too much before you have finished adding the fillings, return it to a pot over low heat and stir until softened, then continue.
6.
Spoon the marshmallow mixture into the prepared pan and, using gloved hands or a buttered spatula, press evenly to fill the pan. Press additional pieces of pretzel and chips on top, if desired. Let stand to cool completely. Remove from pan, using overhanging parchment to lift, and cut into squares.
7.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup stout and the chopped milk chocolate. Microwave for 10 seconds, then stir. Microwave again in 10-second intervals, stirring each time, until melted and smooth. Drizzle chocolate mixture over the squares and let the chocolate cool until set. Serve. To store, cover with plastic wrap. The bars can be kept in a sealed airtight container for up to 3 days.

You'll be in and out of the kitchen in no time.","Yield:Makes one 8-inch pie, serving 4 to 6
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 1","Ingredients
For the Blueberry Topping:
1 pint fresh blueberries (about 10 ounces; 280g)
1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh juice from 1 lime
Freshly grated lime zest from 1/2 lime
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
For the Crust:
5 ounces graham crackers (about 1 cup crumbs/140g, or 1 sleeve of graham crackers, depending on brand)
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 ounces; 60g)
Kosher or sea salt
To Finish:
4 ounces plain, full-fat cream cheese (about 1/2 cup; 115g), cubed
Whipped cream, for serving (optional)","1.
For the Blueberry Topping: In a medium bowl, combine blueberries with lime juice, zest, and brown sugar. Stir well. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.
2.
Meanwhile, for the Crust: In a food processor, pulse graham crackers to a coarse sand texture. Add brown sugar and pulse a few more times to mix.
3.
Turn on your broiler and position top rack 4 to 6 inches from broiler element. Add butter to an 8-inch cast iron skillet and broil until melted and slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Pour melted butter into the food processor work bowl with the graham crackers, add a pinch of salt, and pulse together until mixture resembles a sandy crumb. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water and pulse again. Pour mixture into cast iron skillet and pack down firmly with a rubber spatula.
4.
Broil until crust is set and lightly browned but not burnt, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep an eye on it, as it may burn quickly depending on the strength of your broiler. (A few dark spots are okay; you’ll cover them up with the cream cheese.)
5.
To Finish: Distribute cubed cream cheese evenly over crust, return to broiler, and cook until cheese softens slightly, about 30 seconds. Let stand for 1 minute to warm through, then gently spread cream cheese over the crust to cover it in an even layer.
6.
Scrape blueberry topping into an even layer on the cream cheese, lightly pressing berries into the cream cheese layer without breaking them. Broil until berries just begin to burst and juices bubble, about 4 minutes. Let pie rest on the counter for 30 minutes, or refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, before serving.
7.
Serve, topping with whipped cream if desired.

Tender and creamy fingerling potatoes, smoky Spanish chorizo, onion both pickled and sautéed, and peppery arugula all come together in this easy and hearty potato salad. It's perfect as a side for summer cookouts or as the main event for a simple one-bowl dinner.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6 as a side
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:2 hours","Ingredients
1 3/4 pounds (800g) fingerling potatoes
Kosher salt
4 sprigs fresh oregano or thyme
3 bay leaves
1 medium (6-ounce; 170g) yellow onion, diced, divided
Sherry vinegar, as needed
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
4 ounces (115g) Spanish dry-cured chorizo, preferably younger and more tender, diced
2 ounces (55g) arugula","1.
In a medium saucepan or saucier, cover potatoes with cold water. Add enough salt to make the water unpleasantly salty (don't worry, the potatoes won't end up too salty). Add oregano or thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a bare simmer and cook until you can easily slide a fork through the potatoes, about 25 minutes. (This is a very rough estimate; actual cooking time will vary with the size of the potatoes, so check them often.)
2.
Remove potatoes from heat and let them cool in their cooking water.
3.
Meanwhile, place half the diced onion in a medium nonreactive bowl. Add just enough sherry vinegar to cover and set aside.
4.
In a skillet, warm olive oil over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to a plate. Add remaining onion to skillet, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring frequently, until starting to brown, about 3 minutes; lower heat if onions threaten to burn at any point.
5.
Drain potatoes and discard herbs. If potatoes are very small, you can leave them whole; otherwise, cut into halves or quarters. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Add chorizo and sautéed onion along with the cooking oil.
6.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer quick-pickled onions to bowl with potatoes; reserve vinegar. Toss to combine. Dress with more olive oil as desired, then add reserved vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, tossing between additions, until desired flavor is reached. Season with salt, if needed.
7.
Just before serving, add arugula and toss well. Serve.

Snap Pea and Radicchio Salad With Garlic Yogurt Dressing Recipe,,"[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]
Hearty radicchio is available year-round, but peaks just when sugar snap peas begin popping up. Luckily, sweet and bright snap peas are just what radicchio needs to tame its bite. This bright salad coats chilled, crisp sugar snap peas in a tangy yogurt dressing to contrast warm, charred radicchio.","Yield:Serves 4
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:30 minutes","Ingredients
1 small head radicchio (about 12.5 ounces; 350g)
1 tablespoon olive oil (.5 ounce; 14g)
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 quart sugar snap peas (about 1 pound; 450g)
5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced on a mandoline (about 1 ounce; 30g)
1/3 cup olive oil (2 ounces; 60g)
1/2 cup Greek yogurt, any percentage will do (4.2 ounces; 120g)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill (10g), plus more for garnish
1/3 cup chopped black olive (2.8 ounces; 80g)
1 tablespoon olive brine (.5 ounce; 14g)","1.
Getting Started: Set a stockpot of water (about 4 quarts) on the stove and allow it to come to a boil. Prepare an ice bath in a large mixing bowl with a colander set into it. Preheat the oven's broiler and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
2.
While the water comes to a boil and the broiler preheats, prep the vegetables: Remove any wilted outer leaves on the radicchio and cut in into 8 wedges, leaving the core intact. Toss with the olive oil, salt, and pepper and line up the wedges on the baking sheet. Using a paring knife or tourné knife, remove the ends of the sugar snap peas, pulling away the tough string that runs along the pods.
3.
Cook the Vegetables: Broil the radicchio until the cut edges of the leaves are lightly charred and the core is tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heavily salt the boiling water and blanch the snap peas one handful at a time until bright green but still snappy, about 2 minutes. Using a spider, remove each batch of snap peas to shock in the ice bath until fully cooled. Remove from ice bath and dry in a salad spinner or kitchen towel.
4.
For the Dressing: Over medium heat in a small saucepan, combine the sliced garlic and olive oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until just beginning to turn light golden brown. Immediately strain the oil over a bowl large enough to toss the snap peas, reserving the garlic chips for garnish.
5.
Add the yogurt, dill, olive, and olive brine to the garlic oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss the blanched snap peas with the yogurt dressing. Serve right away alongside wedges of the warm radicchio. Garnish with the reserved garlic chips and more fresh dill.

Nutella and Brown Butter Rugelach With Peanuts and Vanilla Glaze Recipe,,"[Photograph: Emily Dryden]
All the flavors of the classic Tin Roof sundae (or a Drumstick from the ice cream truck, if you prefer). Browned butter stands in for caramel in the flaky pastry, which is wrapped around salty peanuts and a swipe of Nutella. The vanilla glaze ties all the flavors up in a bow, but don't even think about drizzling it on until the cookie has completely cooled.","Yield:Makes 12 or 16 cookies, depending on form
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:4 hours","Ingredients
For the Dough:
4 1/4 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 118g), plus more for dusting
4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), browned, strained, chilled until hard, and cut into large cubes
4 ounces cold cream cheese (8 tablespoons; 115g), cut into large cubes
1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
For the Filling and Egg Wash:
1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) finely chopped salted peanuts
2 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs
4 ounces (about 1/2 cup) Nutella
1 egg yolk whisked with 1 teaspoon cool water
For the Glaze:
4 ounces (about 1 cup, spooned) confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon (15ml) whole milk
1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract","1.
For the Dough: In the work bowl of a food processor, combine flour, brown butter, cream cheese, and salt. Pulse 4 to 5 times, then turn the processor on and process until the dough forms a shaggy ball, about 1 minute.
2.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured sheet of plastic wrap and lightly flour your hands. If making crescent cookies, gently form a disk 5 inches in diameter. If making sliced cookies, form dough into a 3- by 4-inch rectangle. Dust surface with flour and wrap tightly. Lightly press with a rolling pin to smooth, then lightly tap the disk or rectangle's edges on the counter. The smoother the edges, the less prone they will be to cracking later on. Chill until the dough registers 40°F (4°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour. The dough may be frozen for 3 months; defrost overnight in the refrigerator to proceed.
3.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Stack 2 baking sheets and line the top one with parchment paper.
4.
For the Filling: In a small bowl, combine peanuts and bread crumbs.
5.
For Crescent-Style Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 9-inch circle, using a dinner plate and paring knife to trim edges. Spread Nutella over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle peanut and bread crumb mixture evenly over filling. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut disk into 16 equal wedges. Starting from the wide end of each long triangle, roll up and press on the pointy end to seal. Place seam side down on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining triangles, working quickly and placing cookies about 2 inches apart. Transfer baking sheet to the freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
6.
For Sliced Rugelach: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 4- by 12-inch rectangle. Spread Nutella over surface of dough using an offset spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the two 12-inch edges. Sprinkle peanut and bread crumb mixture evenly over filling. Starting at one 12-inch edge, tightly roll dough into a spiral. Aim to make 3 full revolutions, pressing seam firmly to seal. Place roll on baking sheet and freeze or refrigerate for at least 30 and no more than 45 minutes. (If chilled for longer, allow dough to warm very slightly at room temperature, so it will not crack when sliced.) Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut roll into 12 cookies, each the shape of an isosceles trapezoid. Keep the smaller edge of the trapezoid no less than 1/2 inch in length, and the larger edge no more than 1 1/2 inches in length. Place seam side down on baking sheet and transfer to freezer for at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Alternatively, freeze hard and transfer to freezer bags or containers for up to 6 months; defrost in the refrigerator overnight to proceed.
7.
To Finish and Bake: Brush cookies' surface with egg wash using a small pastry brush. Bake cookies until browned and flaky, about 22 to 25 minutes. Some filling may squish out; that’s okay. The bottoms of the rugelach should be caramelized, not blackened. Transfer the cookies (still on the parchment) to a rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.
8.
For the Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Use a fork to drizzle over chilled cookies, or transfer to a pastry bag and pipe over cookies. Let glaze firm up, then store rugelach in an airtight container, layered between sheets of wax paper, for up to 3 weeks, or freeze for up to 1 month.

Roasted Mushrooms With Rosemary and Garlic Recipe,,"Photographs: Marvin Gapultos
Meaty cremini mushrooms are tossed in a simple dressing of red wine vinegar, dijon mustard, olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped rosemary, then placed into a hot oven until tender. As they roast, the spongy mushrooms not only absorb the sharp and herbaceous flavors of the dressing, but their own meaty mushroom flavor intensifies as well.
After removing the mushrooms from the oven, they can be served warm or at room temperature. But if your guests have enough wine in them, they might not want to wait that long. In that case, just pass out the forks and let your guests dig in.","Yield:Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:45 minutes
Rated: 4.5","Ingredients
4 medium garlic cloves, minced (about 4 teaspoons)
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1/2 cup olive oil
2 pounds crimini mushrooms, wiped clean
1 tablespoon lemon juice from 1 lemon
Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish","1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat the oven to 400°F.
2.
In a large bowl, add the garlic, rosemary, red wine vinegar, mustard, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and whisk until well combined. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, while constantly whisking, and mix until the dressing thickens and emulsifies. Add the mushrooms to the bowl and toss until all the mushrooms are coated in the dressing.
3.
Pour the dressing and the mushrooms into a large baking dish and arrange the mushrooms in a single layer. Place the mushrooms in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mushrooms, then continue roasting until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes longer.
4.
Allow the mushrooms to cool slightly. Transfer the mushrooms to a large serving dish, then stir in the lemon juice. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve the mushrooms warm, or at room temperature, with crusty bread for dipping into the extra dressing.

Chocolate Oatmeal Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
This recipe is my attempt to re-create the original version of this pie from the Brooklyn pie shop, Four and Twenty Blackbirds. It comes pretty darn close to replicating the original, which features a flaky all-butter crust, a layer of rich ganache, and a layer of gooey oatmeal that gets all caramelized and crisp on top.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:6 hours","Ingredients
One half recipe Easy Pie Dough, shaped and chilled in a pie plate
5 ounces dark chocolate
5 ounces heavy cream
Pinch of salt
6 ounces Lyle's Golden Syrup (or dark corn syrup)
2 ounces molassas
3 ounces light brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 egg
2 yolks
Pinch of nutmeg
Pinch of salt
9 ounces Old Fashioned oats (not quick-cooking)","1.
Prepare the crust: Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line the bottom of the chilled pie crust with foil or parchment paper and fill it with pie weights (I reuse dried beans for this purpose) and bake for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven, rotating halfway through. Remove the weights and liner and bake for an additional 15 minutes, until the bottom of the pie begins to brown. Remove the shell from the oven and allow it to cool.
2.
Make the ganache: Finely chop the chocolate and place in a bowl with the salt. In a medium-sized saucepan, set over medium heat, bring the heavy cream just to a boil. Remove from the stove and immediately pour the cream over the chocolate. Allow the chocolate to sit for 2 minutes, then stir until the ganache is completely smooth. Pour the ganache into the bottom of the cooled pie shell and place in the fridge until the ganache has hardened, at least 1 hour.
3.
Make the oatmeal topping and bake: Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, whisk together the syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and yolks, then add to the ingredients in the large bowl, and whisk to combine. Add the oatmeal stir well. Pour oatmeal mixture over the top of chilled ganache and spread it evenly. Bake until the top of the pie is a golden brown, 15-20 minutes. If the crust becomes too dark, place patches of foil around the edges to protect it from the heat. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.

Grilled-Kale Salad With Warm Bacon Vinaigrette Recipe,,"Grilled kale and bacon bring smokiness to this warm, rich side dish that's perfect for a barbecue. [Photograph: Lauren Rothman]
Kale is one of the trendiest vegetables these days, but it's still possible to serve it in a surprising way: grilled. Smoky and with a touch of crunch, hearty lacinato leaves are a delightful, if unusual, vehicle for a vinaigrette made with crisped bacon, shallots, and apple cider vinegar. It's a killer side dish you'll want to nestle alongside your potato salad and hamburgers at your next BBQ.
Why this recipe works:
Hearty leaves of lacinato kale stand up well to a grill's high heat, taking on flavor and texture without burning or wilting too much.
Shallots and apple cider vinegar bring sweetness and tang to smoky bacon in a rich dressing that comes together in just minutes.","Yield:serves 4
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:25 minutes","Ingredients
1 large bunch lacinato (a.k.a. Tuscan or dinosaur) kale (about 1 pound)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 ounces (about 3 slices) bacon, chopped
1 small shallot, peeled and minced (about 3 tablespoons)
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar","1.
Light 1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over the coal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, preheat a gas grill to high, covered, for at least 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
2.
Remove stems from kale: carefully cut out thick portion of kale stem from each leaf, leaving leaves intact otherwise. In a large bowl, toss kale with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
3.
Using tongs, add kale leaves to grill, cover grill, and cook until bottom sides are lightly charred, about 2 minutes. Flip kale leaves, cover grill, and cook until other side is lightly charred, about 1 minute longer. Remove kale from grill and set aside to cool.
4.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add bacon and, when it begins to sizzle, add shallots and cook, stirring, until bacon is crispy, about 4 minutes. Add vinegar and cook briefly, stirring, just until dressing thickens and becomes glossy, about 1 minute.
5.
Roughly chop kale and place in a serving bowl. Toss with enough vinaigrette to lightly coat leaves and serve immediately with any remaining dressing on the side.

Cherry-Honey Blondies With Marcona Almonds Recipe,,"[Photograph: Carrie Vasios Mullins]
These rich blondies are flavored with honey, studded with dried cherries, and topped with salty, crunchy Marcona almonds. They'll satisfy fruit and nut lovers alike.
Why this recipe works
Using honey in place of some sugar adds extra flavor. We like to use a strongly flavored honey such as tupelo or orange blossom.
Stirring the dried cherries into the batter ensures a chew while sprinkling the nuts over the top makes a crunchy, almost-crust. It's more interesting texturally than if you were to stir everything together","Yield:makes 12 blondies

Wipe the pot out with a paper towel to remove any unpopped kernels. Return the pot to low heat, then add the butter. Stir until the butter is completely melted. Once the butter melts, add the cranberries and rum to the pot and stir to combine. Continue to cook over low heat for 1 minute longer.
5.
Pour the cranberry mixture into the paper bag with the popcorn. Sprinkle in the salt and sugar, crimp the bag closed, and shake vigorously until the popcorn is uniformly coated with the butter and seasonings. Transfer the contents of the bag to a large bowl and serve immediately.

Pistachio Millionaire's Shortbread With Coriander Butterscotch Recipe,,"[Photograph: Robyn Lee
Millionaire's shortbread is one of those ""I can't believe we ate the whole thing"" desserts. It's not to be taken lightly. But if you have the power to resist inhaling a batch of warm, gooey, caramel- and chocolate-slathered butter cookies, you're a stronger soul than I. This version incorporates ground pistachios and lemon zest into the cookie dough for a rich and nutty shortbread base.
Though millionaire's shortbread is traditionally made with a stiff caramel sauce, I opted instead for a butterscotch to show off coriander's many virtues. Its spicy citrus notes play well off the considerable butter and whiskey in this recipe, and also makes the shortbread a little lighter. Frankly, I could eat this sauce on anything.
You can serve this dessert in a couple ways. My favorite is to plate big slabs of warm-from-the-oven shortbread, then spoon on the toasty butterscotch and add a drizzle of melted chocolate. It should be eaten with a fork, ideally with tea. But you can also make bar cookies: let the shortbread cool completely, then spread on the butterscotch and pop it in the fridge till it's cooled into a semi-hard candy. Spread on the chocolate, chill again, and cut into squares (which freeze beautifully).","Yield:8-10 (at least)
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:1 1/2 hours, plus chilling time if making bar cookies
Rated: 3","Ingredients
For pistachio lemon shortbread
1 cup (two sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
Zest of one lemon
1 1/4 cup (8 ounces) shelled pistachio nuts
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
For coriander butterscotch
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 1/2 cup raw (turbinado) sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup Irish whiskey
2 tablespoons coriander, toasted and freshly ground, plus more for dusting
2 teaspoons kosher salt
For chocolate topping
8 ounces dark chocolate, about 70% cacao, chopped fine
2 tablespoons unsalted butter","1.
For pistachio lemon shortbread: Preheat oven to 350°F. In an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, cream butter, sugar, salt, and lemon zest on high until pale, fluffy, and almost smooth. Scrape down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
2.
In a food processor, crush pistachios to a fine meal. Small chunks are fine. Decrease mixer speed to medium and add pistachios. Turn mixer down to low and add flour in half-cup installments, scraping down bowl as needed. When all flour is incorporated, increase speed to high and mix just until dough comes together in large clumps.
3.
Turn dough out onto a sheet pan and press down with hands to a 1/2-inch rectangle, approximately 12 inches by 9 inches. Bake on the middle rack of oven for 15 minutes, or until edges brown and top is dry but still slightly sticky. Do not overbake: center of shortbread should still look underdone. Let shortbread cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving warm, or cool completely for bar cookies.
4.
For coriander butterscotch: In a heavy 3 quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Increase heat to high, add sugar, and stir to toast sugar for about 30 seconds. Add cream, whiskey, coriander, and salt, stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring constantly for five to seven minutes, or until a spoon leaves a dry trail across the pan. Set aside to cool slightly. If butterscotch hardens in saucepan, reheat on low, stirring in an extra tablespoon of cream.
5.
For chocolate topping: In a small saucepan, melt chocolate and butter together over low heat, stirring frequently to keep chocolate from burning. When chocolate is mostly melted, remove from heat and stir until no lumps remain.
6.
To assemble: Trim browned edges off warm shortbread and cut into even squares, placing each in center of a plate. Spoon warm butterscotch on top, then drizzle on chocolate topping. To drizzle, gather melted chocolate on a spoon and rapidly flick spoon back and forth about eight inches over plate. Garnish with additional ground coriander, if desired. Serve warm.
7.
To make bar cookies, spread butterscotch over completely cooled shortbread with an offset spatula. Refrigerate or freeze until butterscotch hardens, then spread cooled chocolate on top in a thin layer. Top with a sprinkle of ground coriander and refrigerate until chocolate is firm and glossy. Cut into one-inch squares and serve or wrap in plastic before freezing. Cookies will keep in freezer for 1 month.

Limited Edition Holiday Fauxreos Recipe,,"[Photographs: Sarah Jane Sanders]
I absolutely cannot resist normal sweets kicked into Holiday Mode. You can make the candy cane version or the white chocolate version, or you can do the right thing. You can make white chocolate covered candy cane Faureoxs.
For the thickest, most luxurious coating of white chocolate, you'll need to dip the cookies twice. Once is all you need to get the taste just right, but to match a real white chocolate covered Oreo's thick texture, you'll need to double dip. If you don't mind the chocolate wafers showing through just a bit, only make a half batch of ganache and give each cookie a single coating.
Substitute rice flour for all purpose to make a gluten free version. The result is absolutely indistinguishable in both flavor and texture.
Note: All measurements are in weights, as volume measures can be very imprecise. I strongly recommend using a scale for all pastry projects. Serious Eats' recommended kitchen scale is the Oxo Good Grips Scale with Pull Out Display.","Yield:Makes 32 sandwich cookies
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:2 hours","Ingredients
3 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature
3 3/4 ounces sugar
1 1/2 ounces brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon peppermint oil
2 egg yolks
4 ounces all purpose flour (or rice flour), sifted
3 ounces cocoa powder, sifted
For the filling:
2 ounces shortening or unsalted butter at room temperature
5 ounces powdered sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon peppermint oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
optional: red or pink food coloring
4 candy canes, crushed
White Chocolate Coating:
8 ounces cream
19 ounces white chocolate, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt","1.
To make the cookies: Using a hand or stand mixer set to medium speed, cream together butter, both sugars, salt baking powder, baking soda, vanilla extract and peppermint oil until combined. With mixer still running, add in egg yolks one at a time. Once incorporated, shut off mixer and scrape bowl down with a rubber spatula.
2.
Turn mixer to its lowest setting. Dump in flour and cocoa all at once. The mixture will be stiff. Continue mixing until uniform. Shut off mixer. Use a spatula to scrape the dough from the bowl and knead lightly to form a smooth ball. Use your hands to flatten into a disc.
You may begin rolling the dough right away, or you may wrap it with plastic and refrigerate for up to a week.
If you've kept the dough refrigerated, let it sit at room temperature to soften before starting to roll.
3.
Preheat oven to 350° F. Sift some cocoa powder onto the counter (using cocoa instead of flour gives the Fauxreos their uniquely dark color). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to 1/8"" thickness (as thick as 3 dimes, stacked).
When finished, slide a metal spatula between the dough and counter to loosen. This will prevent the cookies from sticking.
A 2"" round cutter makes perfect ""Oreos"" but use any cutter you like. Cut out the cookies and use a metal spatula to lift and transfer to cookie sheet.
Arrange cookies on ungreased cookie sheet. (If the cookie sheet is dinged up or uneven, line with parchment paper first.) The cookies will not spread during baking, so they may be arranged quite close together. Set the sheets aside.
4.
Gather up, knead, and re-roll the remaining dough scraps, likewise cutting and arranging on a cookie sheet.
To pipe a design on the cookies, place any remaining dough in a mixing bowl. Mix with a hand or stand mixer and add about 1 tsp of hot water. Continue adding hot water, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough has thinned into a paste. You can always add more liquid, but you can't take it away. Add slowly and let each addition mix in fully before adding more. When the mixture reaches a frosting-like consistency, use a spatula to scrape it out. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a very small tip, or a heavy duty Ziploc bag with a tiny hole poked in the corner.
Holiday Oreos have winter-themed designs atop them, like snowflakes and ice skates.
5.
Once the cookies have been decorated, bake for about 12 minutes, or until quite firm to the touch. If your oven has an uneven heating element, rotate the cookie sheets after six minutes. Once the cookies have baked, cool thoroughly, directly on the cooling rack.
6.
To make the filling: With a hand or stand mixer, cream together shortening/butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt. Cream on medium speed for five minutes; use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl down periodically. The long mixing time aerates the filling, making it especially white and less gritty.
Using a spatula, transfer half the filling to a small pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Alternately you can use a Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off as a makeshift pastry bag.
Add the peppermint oil and the food coloring to the remaining mixture and beat until evenly colored (or don't! It looks really nice kinda swirled and uneven). Likewise transfer this mixture to a piping bag.
7.
To assemble the cookies: Flip half the wafers upside down. Onto each, pipe a swirl of vanilla filling, like you're making a yin-yang symbol. After, pipe on the other half with the peppermint. To finish, sprinkle each cookie generously with crushed candy cane bits, then top with remaining wafers. Press down with your fingers, applying very even pressure so the filling will spread uniformly across the cookie.
Transfer cookies to an airtight container and refrigerate for several hours. This is crucial. After whipping the filling, it will be quite soft. Refrigerating it will solidify the filling, restoring its proper texture, and bonding it with the wafers.
If you plan to dip the cookies, store them in the freezer until needed (dipping them while cold helps the ganache coat them in a thicker layer).
8.
To make the white chocolate coating:
In a small sauce pan, bring cream to a simmer. Shut off the heat and begin adding white chocolate a little at a time, while whisking. Continue whisking until white chocolate has melted completely. If the mixture becomes too thick or too cool and it seems the white chocolate has stopped melting, turn the heat to low and whisk until melted. Whisk in the salt.
Transfer this white chocolate mixture to the smallest bowl you have that will accommodate it. (This creates more depth, making dipping easier.) Let the white chocolate stand, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming, until it is no longer hot. It should be about body temperature.
9.
Dip the cookies:
Have a parchment lined sheet pan standing nearby.
Drop one cookie into the center of the bowl. Use a fork to submerge it completely. Lift it from the ganache and tap the fork against the edge of the bowl quite firmly to encourage excess ganache to drip off. Drag the cookie bottom across the edge of the bowl to scrape off any excess from the bottom, and transfer to the parchment lined pan.
Continue dipping all the cookies; if the ganache becomes too thick, microwave for just 10 seconds and stir with a fork to restore fluidity, then continue dipping.
Refrigerate the cookies for about 20 minutes, until the ganache has set. Dip the cookies a second time, warming the bowl of ganache in the microwave as needed. Return the cookies to the fridge to set, and then? Dig in.
Store the dipped cookies in the fridge for several days. Undipped cookies will last, refrigerated, about two weeks.

Irish Stout Granita With Raw Oysters Recipe,,"[Photograph: Marvin Gapultos. Video: Vicky Wasik]
A cold pint of stout and a plate of freshly shucked oysters may seem like an odd coupling at first. But the dry bitterness and roasty malt flavors of a stout play very well against the sweet and briny flavors of a fresh oyster—even more so when the stout is frozen and flaked into an icy granita that can be spooned over the fresh oyster just before slurpage.
The beer I chose for this stout granita was Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, which is a bit stronger in flavor (and alcohol) than regular Guinness Stout. If you can't find Guinness FES in your neck of the woods, regular Guinness, or your favorite stout or porter, will work just as well.

1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus more for garnish
1 medium shallot, finely diced (about 2 tablespoons)
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
One dozen fresh oysters, scrubbed clean
Malt vinegar, to taste","1.
Pour the beer into an 8x8 baking dish, then stir in the black pepper and lemon zest. Place the dish into the freezer.

Start checking the dish after 20 minutes. Once the mixture begins freezing around the edges, use a fork to stir the mixture and break up any large pieces of ice. Rake the frozen crystals toward the center of the dish.
3.
Return the dish to the freezer and check the mixture every 10 minutes, continuing to scrape and break apart any large chunks of ice and rake them to the center of the dish. Repeat every 10 minutes until you have very fine, almost snow-like, crystals. Because there is so little liquid in this granita, it won't take long to freeze completely.
4.
When ready to serve, shuck oysters. Shake a few dashes of malt vinegar onto each of the shucked oysters, between 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon depending on taste. Spoon some of the granita onto each of the shucked oysters, then garnish each with the additional lemon zest, shallots, and parsley. Serve immediately.

Snowball Cookies Recipe,,"[Photograph: Vicky Wasik]
My mother, the queen of Christmas cookies (even years after her death), made dozens and dozens of varieties every year. Some of my earliest cookie memories were of her Christmas snowballs. Buttery and nutty and melt-in-your-mouth tender, they were delicious!

Crushed ice is essential here to give the drink adequate dilution and chill. If you don't have a Lewis bag and mallet, fill a zipper-lock plastic bag with ice, wrap it in a dish towel, and give it a few wallops with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin.

Winter Greens with Roasted Pears and Pecorino Recipe,,"[Photograph: Ray Kachatorian]
Winter greens aren't nearly as delicate as their summery counterparts, but when it comes to making cool weather salads they do quite nicely. This salad of Winter Greens with Roasted Pears and Pecorino adapted from Sara Kate Gillingham-Ryan's Good Food to Share takes advantage of bitter greens like kale or sorrel, incorporating them into a hearty salad of sweetly roasted pears, pine nuts, and salty shaved percorino. Once dressed, the acid from the Champagne vinaigrette immediately begins to break down the greens ever so slightly, taking away some their chewiness but none of that great bitter flavor that pairs so well with the pears and pecorino.

4 handfuls mixed winter greens, tough stems removed and torn or cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 cup coarsely grated pecorino cheese
2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 large shallot, finely chopped
1/4 cup nut oil such as walnut, almond, or pecan
Sea salt and freshly ground pepper","1.
Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2.
In a small, dry frying pan, toast the pine nuts over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately pour onto a plate to cool; the nuts can burn quickly. Set aside.
3.
Cut each pear half into 6 thin wedges. In a bowl, toss the pear wedges with the olive oil and the table salt. Arrange the pears in a single layer in a baking pan or on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and, using tongs, gently turn the pears. Return to the oven and roast until tender and slightly browned, 3–5 minutes longer. Let cool.
4.
In a shallow salad bowl, combine the greens, pine nuts, and cheese and toss to mix.
5.
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, and shallot. Add the nut oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until a smooth, emulsified dressing forms. Season with sea salt and pepper.

Candied Almond Chocolate Chip Biscotti Recipe,,"[Photograph: Carrie Vasios Mullins]
If you're looking for an extra crunchy biscotti with updated flavors, give this chocolate chip and candied almond version a try.
Why this recipe works:
Like traditional Italian biscotti, these cookies are made without butter, which keeps them extra crisp and light.
Cinnamon coated candied almonds are an easy way to add a subtle background of cinnamon to the whole cookie—their flavor permeates the dough. If you can only find regular candied almonds, add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the dough with the dry ingredients.
The slight bitterness of dark chocolate chips helps balance the sweetness from the almonds, while making them pretty addictive flavor-wise.
Note: I used the cinnamon coated almonds from Trader Joes","Yield:Makes 2 dozen biscotti
Active time: 15 minutes
Total time:1 hour","Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

3.
Using well floured hands (dough will be sticky) divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each into a 2-inch wide log and place on baking sheet. Bake until just starting to turn golden at the edges, 30 minutes.
4.
Carefully transfer logs to a cutting board and let cool 10 minutes. Use a serrated knife to cut logs into 1-inch cookies. Place cookies, cut side up, on the baking sheet. Bake until just lightly toasted, another 20 minutes. Let cool completely.

John McCarthy's Scotch Regency Punch Recipe,,"[Photo: Robyn Lee]
This drink disappeared within half an hour at the Serious Eats holiday party—we're guessing that you can write ""cardamom"" on anything and people will love it. Here, it meets lemon, Black Grouse, and soda for what's a essentially a scotch Tom Collins against a cardamom backdrop.
If you're more into rum than Scotch, swapping out the Black Grouse for dry Brugal rum works equally well, which McCarthy calls the ""Pedro Collins.""

1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar
3 peppermint candy canes, chopped","1.
Adjust oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. While the oven is preheating, line the bottom of a springform pan with a round of parchment. Fill one third of a medium saucepan with water and set a large, heatproof bowl over the top. Combine chocolate and butter in the bowl, and set the saucepan with the bowl on top over medium heat. As the water begins to steam, it will melt the chocolate and butter. Stir the mixture until it is smooth and shiny, with no lumps. Whisk in the sugar and remove the bowl from the top of the saucepan.

Bûche de Noël Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
Making a traditional Bûche de Noël is a lengthy project that requires time and planning. you'll want to make many of the components in advance so they have time to chill: the mushroom meringues, soaker, compote, and pastry cream keep for up to 2 days before use. Once you're ready to go, make the sponge for the cake just before assembly. It should cool but should not sit too long or it will dry out and crack. This cake features a flavor combination that I learned from a French baker who told me her mother made it this way when she was a girl. The combination of chestnuts, cranberries, and praline is unique, and transports her back to her childhood.
The recipe for the chestnut pastry cream is adapted from Johnny Iuzzini's recipe, which appeared originally on the Martha Stewart Show.

Right this way for a step-by-step slideshow of the techniques used in this recipe!","Yield:serves 12
Active time: 3 hours
Total time:8 hours","Ingredients
one recipe Swiss Buttercream, with 3 ounces praline paste whisked in
450 grams milk
100 grams granulated sugar
50 grams all purpose flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
5 ounces chestnut paste
30 grams dark rum
8 ounces fresh cranberries
75 grams sugar (plus more to taste)
50 grams water
100 grams sugar
125 grams granulated sugar
100 grams water
4 egg whites
booze or extract for flavor
4 egg yolks
125 grams cake flour, sifted
60 grams butter, melted and cooled
Mushroom Meringues, marzipan decorations, melted chocolate, piped (all optional)","1.
Make the pastry cream: Place milk and vanilla bean seeds in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, sift together flour, sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Add eggs, and whisk mixture until pale and stiff. Continue whisking while slowly adding half of the hot milk mixture. Transfer egg mixture to saucepan with the remaining milk mixture. Place over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, and bring to a boil. Cook for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together chestnut paste and rum, if using. Remove egg mixture from heat, and whisk in chestnut paste mixture. Pour mixture into a wide shallow dish, and cover the surface directly with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until cool. Whisk before using.
2.
Make the cranberry compote: Place the fresh cranberries, sugar, and water in a saucepan over medium heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Turn the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer until the cranberries have burst and the sauce has reduced, approximately 15 minutes. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness by adding additional sugar. Remove from heat, place in an airtight container and chill until completely cool. Whisk before use.
3.
Make the soaker: Combine the 100 grams of sugar, water, and booze or flavoring (to taste, if using), in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once the mixture reaches a boil, turn off the heat and allow to cool completely before using.
4.
Make the sponge cake roll: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Draw an X across the center of a jelly roll pan with a small pat of butter and line the pan with parchment paper. Prepare a French meringue with the egg whites and sugar and whisk the meringue to stiff peaks in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. The meringue should be shiny and smooth, not puffy and dull. Whisk the egg yolks and fold them into the meringue, then fold in the cake flour, taking care not to deflate the batter. Fold in the cooled, melted butter. Immediately pour the batter onto the parchment-lined pan and spread it evenly with a large offset spatula. Bake the sponge for approximately 5-7 minutes, or until it is browned and springs back to the touch. Do not over-bake, or the sponge will be too stiff to roll. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife along the edges, place another piece of parchment on top and an inverted jelly roll pan atop the parchment, and flip the cake onto the inverted pan. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, and make the roulade as soon as the cake is cool to prevent hardening.
5.
Assemble: With the sponge sitting on a piece of parchment, brush the cake with soaker using a pastry brush. Spread an even layer of pastry cream over the entire cake (between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick) using an offset spatula. Sprinkle small amounts of the cranberry compote over the surface. Using the parchment underneath to stabilize, begin rolling the cake into the roulade the long way, as you would a carpet, resting the roll on the seam. Cut the cake on an angle 1/3 way up the roulade using a serrated knife, then cut a round off of the bottom of the small piece. Arrange the bigger part of the roulade on a serving plate, and cover with a thick layer of buttercream. Arrange the smaller pieces so they look like branches coming out of the big roulade, then frost the smaller pieces with buttercream. Draw patterns in the buttercream to resemble bark, and decorate the cake as you see fit. The cake can be stored in the fridge until serving, but do not refrigerate the meringues or they will melt.

No-Bake Blood Orange Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
This creamy, rich, no-bake pie is screaming for some acidic fruit to balance it, and here in blood orange (also sometimes called Moro oranges) season, we have our perfect topping.
This recipe is adapted from Martha Stewart's recipe for no-bake cheesecake. It's a great trick to have up your sleeve when you are stuck without an oven. The cool, creamy cheesecake filling goes perfectly with the tangy supremes of blood orange.
For help cutting orange supremes, check out this video.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:4 hours
Rated: 5","Ingredients
15 sheets graham crackers
8 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
16 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
14 ounces condensed milk (1 can)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3-4 blood oranges, supremed (peel, pith, and fibers all removed)","1.
Put graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, and crush them with a rolling pin until very fine crumbs form. Pour crumbs into a medium bowl; stir in sugar and salt. Add butter, and stir until well combined. Press the crumb mixture into the pie plate, spreading it 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the side; press flat. Chill crust in freezer at least 10 minutes.
2.
Meanwhile, make the filling: Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the condensed milk a little at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the vanilla extract.
3.
Pour the filling into the crust; smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, 3 hours. When ready to serve, supreme the oranges: using a serrated knife, cut off the top and bottom, just so the flesh is showing. Then, cut away the peel and pith in vertical strips, until all that is exposed is flesh. Using a pairing knife, cut the segments out in wedges. Arrange the supermes on top of the pie for serving.

Marinated Goat Cheese Recipe,,"[Photograph: Emily and Matt Clifton]
For an almost effortless way to a more interesting cheese platter, marinate fresh goat cheese in olive oil with herbs and spices. Here we add fennel seed, lemon zest, bay leaves, and more for a well-rounded infusion of flavor. Use it as a topping for crackers, a spread for sandwiches, or crumbled into salads.","Yield:Makes 2 half-pint jars
Active time: 10 minutes
Total time:10 minutes plus at least 2 hours marinating time","Ingredients
1 large log fresh goat cheese (10 ounces; 270g)
2 cups extra-virgin olive oil (475ml), or as needed
1 teaspoon red chili flakes
1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds
2 teaspoons pink peppercorns (optional)
4 (2-inch) strips lemon zest (peeled with a vegetable peeler with as little white pith as possible)
4 bay leaves
6 sprigs fresh thyme
4 medium garlic cloves, cut in half lengthwise","1.
Cut goat cheese log into 8 equal pieces; roll into balls, if desired.
2.
Pour olive oil into clean wide-necked jars until halfway full. Distribute chili flakes, fennel seed, and peppercorns equally into both jars.
3.
Add the goat cheese pieces one at a time, adding a little olive oil between each one so they are fully immersed. Add lemon zest, bay leaves, thyme and garlic to jars. Pour in enough olive oil to fully cover cheese. Seal jars and refrigerate for at least a few hours (we found it tasted best after 2 days). The marinated goat cheese can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week, but not any longer than that (infused olive oil can run the risk of botulism if kept for longer than 1 week, even if refrigerated).

Cranberry Apple Nut Tart Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
This updated take on a classic includes apples and cranberries for a nice tart zing and a sweet and crumbly tart crust made even more delicious with the addition of toasted pecans. It's the perfect little finish to any winter meal. Be sure to blanch your apple slices prior to baking, a great technique to ensure that the apples cook without drying out.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 1 hour
Total time:8 hours","Ingredients
For The Tart Dough:
3/4 cup whole pecans, lightly toasted and cooled
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
3/4 cup butter, room temperature
3 egg yolks
1 1/4 cups all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
For The Filling:
5 apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/8th inch pieces
1/2 cup almond paste, room temperature
2 tablespoons butter, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar, divided, plus additional sugar for sprinkling
Pinch of salt
1 egg
1 cup whole fresh cranberries","1.
Place the pecans and confectioner's sugar in the bowl of a food processor, fitted with a blade and pulse for 20 seconds, until the pecans are broken into a uniform, mealy consistency. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter to a smooth, light consistency. Add the pecan mixture and mix on medium speed until the butter and pecan mixture are completely combined. Add the egg yolks and mix until completely combined. Add the flour and salt and mix on low speed until completely incorporated, taking care not to overmix. Form the dough into a disk shape and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours (overnight is ideal).
2.
Once the dough has chilled, unwrap it, place it on a floured surface, and roll it out into a 1/4 inch thick circle (this dough is very tender and delicate, if it crumbles a bit, do not worry, you can use scraps to patch it up in the pan). Transfer the dough to a 12 inch circular tart pan with a removable bottom. Puree with your fingertips to shape the dough, and to fill in any holes with patches of dough. Allow the edges of the dough to extend just slightly higher than the tart pan walls (you can trim these back after chilling) and chill for at least 1 hour.
3.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. When oven is ready, line chilled pie shell with foil or parchment paper and fill with weights (I reuse dried beans for this), and bake on the lowest rack of the oven for 10 minutes. Remove weights and liner, turn pie, and bake until the bottom crust just begins to puff slightly, about 10 minutes more. Remove pie shell from oven and allow to cool completely.
4.
Place the apple slices in a large, heatproof bowl. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil and pour the water over the apples. Allow them to sit for 2 minutes, then pour the apples through a strainer to drain. Shake the apples in the strainer repeatedly to expel all excess water. Allow the apples to cool and set aside.
5.
In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the almond paste, butter, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and pinch of salt. Mix on medium speed until it forms a smooth paste. Add the egg and mix until combined. Smooth the frangipane over the bottom of the tart shell. In a medium bowl, toss the cranberries and blanched apples with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar. The cranberries will settle to the bottom of the bowl. Scoop them out and press them into the frangipane in the tart shell. Arrange the apple slices in a fanned style over the top. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 350°F centered on the middle rack of the oven for 20 minutes, then turn and bake for an additional 20-25, until the frangipane puffs up around the apples. Allow the tart to cool completely before serving.

Cobb Salad-Inspired Brussels Sprouts With Lemon Vinaigrette Recipe,,"Brussels sprouts get updated in this Cobb salad-inspired take. [Photograph: Jennifer Olvera]
Although now trendy, brussels sprouts long had a bad rap. I blame that in part to the sweet preparations out there, or ones that don't take into account their bitter edge. To temper that, I've employed a lemon vinaigrette to give the bitterness someplace to ""go.""
By preparing them half flash-sautéed over high heat, half raw, they maintain some crunch. Served at room temperature stippled with pancetta (or bacon), blue cheese, and tomatoes, they barely recollect the Thanksgiving side dish of yore.

1/3 cup cake flour
1/4 cup confectioners’ sugar
About 1 cup Flavored Simple Syrup (recipe follows)
Chocolate Pastry Cream (recipe follows)
Coffee Buttercream (recipe follows)
Meringue Mushrooms (recipe follows)
Small block of bittersweet chocolate, for shaving
1 1/4 cups water
2/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other liqueur
4 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 large egg yolks, at room temperature
1 cup whole milk
1/2 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise
3 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate
3 large egg yolks, at room temperature
1 large whole egg, at room temperature
Scant 1 cup sugar
1/3 cup water
1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed
Pure coffee extract to taste
3 large egg whites, at room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup confectioners’ sugar
1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder","1.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a 15 1/2–by—10 1/2—by 1—inch baking sheet (jelly-roll or quarter sheet pan) with parchment paper.
2.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip, combine the whole eggs, egg yolks, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the milk and beat on medium-high speed for about 6 minutes, or until the mixture is very light and has tripled in volume.
3.
Place the egg whites in a bowl and, using a handheld mixer, whip on medium speed until foamy. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar a tablespoon at a time and continue to beat. When the sugar has been incorporated, raise the speed to medium-high and whip for about 5 minutes, or until stiff, but not dry, peaks form.
4.
Using a rubber spatula, gently fold about half of the whole egg mixture into the egg whites. When almost incorporated, fold in the remaining half, taking care not do deflate the batter.
5.
Place the flour in a fine-mesh sieve and, tapping on the side of the sieve, sift the flour over the meringue batter. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the flour into the batter, making sure the spatula reaches to the bottom of the bowl to ensure an even mixture.
6.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly. Don’t press down too hard, or the pressure will cause the batter to deflate.
7.
Place the confections’ sugar in a fine-mesh sieve and, tapping on the side of the sieve, sift the sugar evenly over the surface of the batter.
8.
Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the cake just begins to brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and immediately run a paring knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake sides. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the top of the cake, and then invert a cookie sheet over the parchment. Immediately invert the cake and the cookie sheet together, then lift off the baking sheet. Peel the parchment paper off the cake. Let cool completely. Line another cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place the cake on a clean, flat work surface with a long side facing you. Drizzle the simple syrup evenly over the cake, using just enough to moisten but not soak the cake. Spoon the pastry cream on top of the cake and, using an offset spatula, carefully spread the cream evenly over the cake, taking care to spread it evenly up to the edges. Starting at the long end farthest from you, slip your fingers between the parchment and the cake and begin rolling the cake toward you, up and over the pastry cream, until you have a firm log shape, or roulade.
9.
Carefully transfer the roulade, seam side down, to the prepared cookie sheet. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to allow the roulade to set.
10.
Transfer the roulade to a serving platter. Using a serrated knife, cut a 1 1/2—inch—thick slice from both ends of the roll. These will be used to form “gnarls” on the finished log.
11.
Using an offset spatula, generously coat the entire log with all but about 1 cup of the buttercream, spreading from left to right in long streaks. Place the 2 reserved slices on top of the log, positioning one at each end and a little off center. Cover the slices with buttercream, using the offset spatula to smooth the top of each piece. Pull a cake comb through the buttercream on the cake so that it resembles tree bark. Then pull the comb up the sides of the slices so that they resemble gnarls on a tree. Place in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to allow the buttercream to set.
12.
While the buttercream is setting, put the mushrooms together by gluing the caps to the stems with a dab of buttercream. Lay them cap side down until ready to place on the cake.
13.
Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Using a sharp knife, carefully peel chocolate shavings off the chocolate block, letting them fall over and around the cake. Arrange the mushrooms around the cake. Serve immediately.
14.
Flavored Simple Syrup
15.
In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the water and sugar, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. When the sugar has dissolved completely, remove the pan from the heat. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool completely.
16.
Stir the liqueur into the cooled syrup. Use immediately, or store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator almost indefinitely.
17.
Chocolate Pastry Cream
18.
-makes about 2 cups-
19.
Sift together 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the cornstarch in a bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks until well blended, thick, and smooth.
20.
In a heavy-bottomed nonreactive saucepan, combine the milk with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Using the edge of a small, sharp knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the milk and then add the bean. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat.
21.
Whisking constantly, whisk about one-third of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the combined mixtures into the hot milk mixture, whisk to combine, and return to medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly to keep the mixture from sticking and burning. Just before the mixture comes to a boil, it should thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon. As soon as the mixture boils, lower the heat slightly and continue to whisk for another 2 minutes to cook out the raw taste of the cornstarch and allow the flavors to mellow.
22.
Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. Cover with plastic film, pressing it directly on the surface to keep a skin from forming, and let cool to room temperature.
23.
Place the chocolate in the top half of a double boiler. Place over (not touching) gently simmering water in the bottom pan and heat, stirring occasionally, until completely melted. Using a rubber spatula, fold the hot chocolate into the cooled pastry cream. Cover with a piece of plastic film until ready to use. If not using immediately, refrigerate for up to 24 hours.
24.
Coffee Buttercream
25.
-makes about 3 cups-
26.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip, combine the egg yolks and whole egg and beat on medium-high speed for about 7 minutes, or until tripled in volume and very thick, light, and airy.
27.
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Clip a thermometer to the side of the pan, place the pan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Boil for about 12 minutes, or until the mixture registers 250 degrees F. When the sugar syrup is ready, remove it from the heat. With the mixer on low speed, carefully pour the hot syrup between the ship and the side of the bowl, taking care not to hit the whip as you pour, or the hot syrup will spatter and burn you. Continue beating on medium speed for about 3 minutes, or until the outside of the bowl is warm but not hot and the mixture is slightly cool.
28.
Add the butter and continue to whip on medium speed for a couple of minutes, or until the butter is incorporated. Raise the speed to medium-high and beat for about 10 minutes, or until thick, smooth, and shiny, and well emulsified. Add the extract, a few drops at a time, beating until the desired flavor is reached. Be careful not to overbeat, or the buttercream will be grainy.
29.
Use immediately, or cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
30.
Meringue Mushrooms
31.
-makes about 2 dozen-
32.
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
33.
Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip and beat on medium speed until foamy. Begin adding the granulated sugar a tablespoon at a time, adding it until the egg whites have increased in volume. Raise the speed to medium-high, add all of the remaining granulated sugar, and beat for about 5 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Lower the speed to medium and continue to beat for an additional 2 minutes to incorporate more air into the whites. They should be very light and stiff, but not dry and separated.
34.
Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold the confectioners’ sugar into the egg whites, taking care not to deflate them and making sure you reach all the way to the bottom of the bowl.
35.
Scrape the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip. To make the mushroom stems, hold the pastry bag at a 90-degree angle and squeeze dime-sized portions of meringue onto the prepared cookie sheet. As you finish squeezing each stem, quickly pull the bag straight up so that you leave a little tail of meringue. Make as many stems as you will need, keeping in mind that baked meringue is fragile and breaks easily, so make a few more than you will actually need. (I like to make enough mushrooms so that everyone can have one when the cake is served.)
36.
Make an equal number of mushroom caps by holding the pastry bag at a slight angle with the tip touching the parchment paper as you begin to pipe individual meringues into 1/2-inch rounds. When you have a 1/2-inch round, immediately stop piping and pull the tip straight up, leaving no tail.
37.
Place the cocoa powder in a fine-mesh sieve and, tapping on the side of the sieve, lightly dust the mushroom caps with cocoa.
38.
Place the meringues in the oven and bake, with the door slightly ajar to allow the moisture to escape, for about 1 hour, or until very dry and firm. If the meringues take on color, the oven is too hot. Remove the pan from the oven, lower the heat, and let the oven cool slightly before returning the pan to continue baking.
39.
Turn off the oven and allow the meringues to cool in the oven for about 1 hour. This helps dry them completely. If you don’t have time to do this, remove the pan from the oven and carefully transfer the meringue pieces to a wire rack to cool.
40.
Store the mushrooms pieces in an airtight and very dry container until ready to put them together when you assemble the cake.

Orange Cake with Mulled Wine Cranberry Jam Recipe,,"Notes:
Whenever I use citrus zest in a recipe, I pulse it with sugar in a food processor to get rid of the shaggy bits, but more importantly, to release the zest's oils. This is completely optional—if you don't feel like using your food processor, skip Step 2 and add the zest in Step 4.
About the buttercream: The meringue has to be cool before you can start adding the butter, one piece at a time. If the butter melts upon contact, keep whipping the meringue until it's cooled further before adding more. As an extra precaution, have a large ice bath ready—should the buttercream turn soupy, simply dip the bottom of the mixing bowl in the ice bath for 30 to 60 seconds, then continue beating in butter.
Be careful when moving the cake layers during assembly—they are a bit delicate.","Yield:8 to 10
Active time: 2 hours

Charles Dickens's Punch Recipe,,"[Photograph: Marleigh Riggins Miller ]
I have an admission to make: I paid very little attention to the ingredients in this punch when I selected it. I had to make it when I found that, instead of making an oleo-saccharum, the lemon peels and liquor are ignited. That's right: you get to light a bowl of booze on fire! (Insert Beavis and Butthead imitation here.)
The bonus is that the resulting punch is delicious, though that is still superseded by the fun/danger combo of hot, flaming liquid--a concept not unfamiliar to this punch's progenitor. As Wondrich notes, Dickens ""was known among his friends for his ritualized performance as he worked up a bowl of jug, complete with running commentary on his ingredients, techniques and progress."" (Though, unlike Dickens's John Jasper in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, the author omits the dash of opium from his drinks.)
The punch itself is simple to make, but you will need some special equipment to prepare it safely. Namely, you'll need an enameled cast iron pot with a lid to ignite the punch and extinguish it, and a long-handled bar spoon to transfer the initial flame to the pot. Always bring fire to the alcohol rather than the alcohol to the fire or you're going to be in a bad situation. Once the blaze is extinguished, however, Charles Dickens's Punch is also particularly versatile, as it can be served hot from the bowl or cooled over ice. In the name of science I sampled it both ways and found each preparation delightful--soothing when hot, refreshing when chilled.
The bright flavor of lemon comes through strongly in this preparation, as do the earthy, sweet-rich vanilla flavors of rum and cognac. Rum and cognac are frequent companions in the punch bowl, as they taste tremendous together. A good-quality rum and cognac are important, as punch really hinges on the flavor of the spirits--just as it does in a great cocktail. A nice aged rum like the Plantation Trinidad or Barbados (vintage 2000) make a lovely base; for the cognac, try Dickens's preferred Courvoisier VSOP or my preferred Pierre Ferrand Ambre.
Technical note: If you have trouble getting the liquor to light, fill your barspoon with an overproof rum like Wray & Nephew White Overproof or Bacardi 151. It will ignite easily and stay lit through the transfer to the pot of punch.","Yield:16 (8-ounce servings)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:30 minutes","Ingredients
3 lemons (preferably organic)
6 ounces demerara sugar
20 ounces Jamaica rum
6 ounces cognac
40 ounces boiling water","1.
Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, peel the three lemons, being careful to remove only the yellow peel and not the bitter white pith. Juice the peeled lemons and set aside.
2.
Place the peels, sugar, rum and cognac in the cast iron pot.
3.
Using a long spoon, remove some of the rum from the pot and light it with a match. While it is is flaming, carefully pour the burning liquor from the spoon into the pot, igniting all of the spirits.
4.
Allow to burn for three or four minutes, then extinguish by covering the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
5.
To the extinguished spirit-sugar-peel mixture, add the reserved lemon juice and the boiling water. Stir well, cover, and let sit for five minutes.
6.
Remove the lid, stir again and taste. Adjust the sweetness with sugar or water if necessary.
7.
Place the pot, covered, on a burner and simmer for fifteen minutes. At this point, you can serve the punch immediately as a hot drink, but remove the lemon peels if you expect to have the punch sitting for more than two hours.
8.
Alternatively, you can allow the punch to cool to room temperature and serve over ice.

Using a metal spatula, place the sliced tomatoes and onions on the hottest part of your grill, taking care to keep the onion rings together and not separated. Grill the tomatoes just until they are nicely charred with grill marks on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Grill onions until they soften and caramelize with grill marks on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer grilled tomatoes and onions to a large platter and set aside. It's ok if the onions separate after grilling.
5.
Brush one side of each baguette slice with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then smear the other side of each baguette slice with the prepared spread. Place the baguette slices, spread side-up, on a large platter.
6.
Place two dill pickle chips on the spread-side of each baguette slice. Fold each slice of American cheese in half over itself, then place each cheese slice on top of the dill pickle chips on each of the baguette slices. Place a single tomato slice on each baguette slice, then evenly distribute the onions over each baguette slice.
7.
Place the topped baguette slices on the cooler side of the grill and cook until the bottom of the bread is toasted and the cheese is completely melted, 3 to 5 minutes. If some of the bruschetta are cooking faster than others, rearrange them on the grill as necessary. Remove the bruschetta from the grill and serve immediately.

Plymouth Pilgrims' Punch Recipe,,"Anybody can ice down a cooler of beer or a chill a few bottles of rosé for an outdoor party. But as I wrote on Wednesday, preparing a large-format punch or pitchers of drinks for your guests is a way to bump up the celebratory spirit without sapping your own time to mingle.
The Plymouth Pilgrims' Punch doesn't have much of a back story. Created by drinks writer David Wondrich as a mashup of several recipes from Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks, from 1869, and included in his book Punch (and also in the sadly departed Gourmet as Gowanus Club Gin Punch, and slightly revamped at Gilt Taste as the Golden Fleece Punch), the punch is composed of a few simple, though flavorful, ingredients. It's also relatively easy to prepare (though there is some work involved), and its flavor is just exciting enough for adventurous tipplers without being so potent, funky or generally weird that it could scare off casual imbibers.
You do need to plan in advance, though—the punch is sweetened and made lusciously rich with pineapple syrup, which doesn't require a lot of work but does take some time to soak. And don't be turned off from the punch if you don't have or don't like yellow Chartreuse; simply substitute another liqueur, preferably a good one (in other words, nix on the Apple Pucker), and you'll have the accent you're looking for.
This recipe makes around 14 cups of punch, and is easily doubled or tripled depending on the size and thirst of your party. If you're serving it all at once to a big crowd, you can simply knock everything together except for the fizz, chill it in the fridge, add the soda at the last minute and serve it over ice.
If it's a smaller gathering, though, and your punch might be consumed over an afternoon, you have a couple of options: one is to put everything into a punch bowl (better yet, use an insulated beverage cooler—it fits the barbecue-casual vibe well, and has the added benefit of keeping the bugs out of the booze), and add a large chunk of ice (simply fill a metal mixing bowl or similar container with water and place in the freezer overnight); or, combine everything except the club soda and chill it in the fridge, then ration it out in pitchers to which you'll add the club soda just prior to serving, and keep it cool with a large chunk of ice made by filling a clean juice-concentrate container with water and freezing overnight.
Made with a little care, the punch is cold, fizzy, flavorful, and just strong enough to get the party started.","Yield:makes 14 servings
Active time: 20 minutes
Total time:around 12 hours","Ingredients
4 cups demerara sugar
2 cups water
1 pineapple, peeled, cored, and diced
3 lemons, washed
2 ounces superfine sugar
3 bags green tea
1 quart hot water
1 liter Plymouth gin
1 ounce yellow Chartreuse or other liqueur of your choice
1 cup fresh lemon juice
1 liter chilled seltzer","1.
Make a rich syrup by combining demerara sugar and 2 cups water over medium-low heat, whisking until sugar is completely dissolved. Let cool.
2.
Add pineapple cubes to the syrup and cover. Let soak overnight at room temperature. Strain the pineapple from the flavored syrup (don't discard the fruit—it's tasty).
3.
Use a sharp vegetable peeler or paring knife to remove the zest from three lemons; avoid the bitter white pith. Place the zest in a bowl and add the superfine sugar. Mash with a wooden muddler until the mixture is fragrant and the lemon oil combines with the sugar to make a thick paste. Let rest one hour, then remove the bits of peel (or leave them in as garnish).
4.
Prepare a weak green tea by soaking 3 tea bags in one quart hot water for three minutes; let cool.
5.
Combine the gin, Chartreuse (or other liqueur), tea, lemon/sugar mixture, lemon juice, and four ounces of the pineapple syrup, and stir until sugar is dissolved. Chill until ready to serve.

Duck Fat Crackers Recipe,,"[Photograph: Anna Markow]
This recipe is based on a lavash cracker recipe I learned at a popular restaurant for which I briefly worked, and when the dough is handled minimally with almost no flour added in the rolling process (which, by the way, can be done with a pasta roller if you're not confident in your abilities to roll dough paper-thin) it results in a perfectly light, crispy cracker which is still sturdy enough to stand up to a slice of cheese perched atop it. The original recipe called for buttermilk as the liquid, but we didn't have any at work when I was testing the recipe. Since I already knew I wanted to add some lemon zest to the dough, I figured I'd sour the milk myself with some lemon juice, which is a nice touch and the fresh acidity helps cut through the rich duck fat.
If you happen to have duck fat that has been previously used for confit, that is actually better for this particular application, since any seasonings or intermingling fats from other animals are just extra flavor in the cracker.
Note: Feel free to use whatever blend of herbs, spices, seeds, etc. you'd like for these crackers. I like to take roughly equal parts of fennel seed, dried basil, thyme leaves, and the black pepper called for and whizz them in the spice grinder to make a sprinkle for these crackers, and they kind of smell like pizza baking. Fatty, ducky pizza.","Yield:Makes several dozen, depending on size
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:12 hours","Ingredients
For Dough
1 cup milk
Juice from 1/2 lemon
4 cups plus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
Zest from 1 lemon
4 ounces duck fat
To Finish
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
Flaky sea salt
Finely ground black pepper
Dried herbs and spices, to taste (see note)","1.
Combine milk and lemon juice, set aside. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in medium mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Add lemon zest and duck fat and cut in with pastry cutter or rub in by hand until mixture is crumbly. Add curdled milk and knead gently until smooth. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, overnight if possible.
2.
Place rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 400°F. Use bench scraper to cut small portions of dough. Use as little flour as possible to roll out gently but evenly until very thin; almost translucent is fine but the dough should not tear. Use a sharp knife or pastry roller to cut strips, then rectangles or triangles from each strip. Lay out evenly on parchment-lined sheet trays (edges may touch but not overlap). Use a fork or very small whisk to mix together egg yolk and water, then brush gently and lightly onto crackers. Prick holes in each cracker with a fork or skewer, then season evenly with salt, pepper and whatever other seasonings you prefer.
3.
Bake for 5 minutes, then rotate pan(s) and continue baking, checking crackers every minute or so. If any appear evenly golden-brown, carefully remove to a separate sheet or cooling rack, then continue baking the rest, removing them as they finish. They take a few minutes to get going but can cook unevenly and burn very quickly so check often (if you have an oven with a glass door and interior light, you'll be at an advantage). Repeat until all crackers are baked and allow to cool fully before storing in airtight containers for up to one week.
Do not bother trying to reuse scraps; no matter how long you rest them the crackers will be thick and possibly tough.

This master deviled egg recipe stands on its own without garnishes, but embellishing the tops is half the fun. We often keep it simple, topping them with just a scattering of chopped fresh chives or a dab of harissa (Tunisian chili paste). But the green color and deep lemony flavor of asparagus tips with preserved lemon; the salty-sea stickiness of salmon roe; the brininess of anchovy-stuffed olives; and the sweet-against-saltiness of chutney and ham are some of our favorite combinations. We're sure you'll come up with your own.","Yield:Makes 24 deviled eggs
Active time: 30 minutes

12 large eggs
1/2 cup (120ml) mayonnaise
2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45ml) sour cream
2 teaspoons (10ml) Dijon mustard
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Optional garnishes: salmon roe and fresh dill sprigs; anchovy-stuffed olives and minced fresh chives; diced ham, Major Grey's–style mango chutney, and thinly sliced scallions; blanched asparagus tips, minced preserved lemon rind, and minced fresh chives (see note)","1.
Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil (a vigorous boil could crack the eggs) and prepare an ice water bath in a large mixing bowl. Using a large spoon, carefully lower eggs into boiling water and cook, maintaining a gentle boil, for 12 minutes. Drain eggs, then transfer to ice bath to chill. Unpeeled boiled eggs can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
2.
When ready to make deviled eggs, crack hard-boiled eggs all over and peel, starting from wider end (where the air sac is). Peeling under cold running water can help get stubborn shell off. Blot peeled eggs dry on clean paper towels.
3.
Halve boiled eggs lengthwise. Pop egg yolks out from whites into the bowl of a food processor. Arrange whites on a paper towel–lined baking sheet, cut side down, and cover with plastic wrap.
4.
Add mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons (30ml) sour cream, and mustard to egg yolks. Purée until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper; add 1 more tablespoon (15ml) sour cream if you want a lighter, slightly tangier filling. Transfer filling to a small bowl and press plastic wrap directly against the surface until you are ready to fill the eggs. (Instead of using a food processor, you can also press cooked yolks through a fine-mesh strainer, using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, then fold in mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and seasonings.)

Using a small spoon, scoop up a dollop of filling, then use a second small spoon to push it into an egg white half. Continue with remaining egg white halves and filling until all are complete. Garnish as desired, then serve.

Add 1 handful of the cheese and cornstarch mixture to the pot and whisk until the cheese is completely melted. Continue adding handfuls of the cheese mixture to the pot, stirring until each addition is melted before adding the next addition of cheese; this will take 2 to 3 minutes. When all of the cheese has been melted, continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the fondue to a bowl and serve immediately with cubed bread, sliced apples, or leftover corned beef as dippers.

Hot Chocolate and Marshmallow Cake Roll Recipe,,"Rolling. [Photograph: María del Mar Sacasa]
My hot chocolate recipe involves butter, cocoa powder, whole milk, and chopped bittersweet chocolate. It's rich, velvety, and the perfect antidote to the winter blues. This cake is inspired by that cold weather favorite.
The cake roll is a spongy chocolate cake, moist and fluffy. The filling is whipped cream, stabilized with cream cheese and unflavored gelatin. Hot chocolate's marshmallow topping had to be represented, and mini ones are folded into the cream. The chewy marshmallows absorb moisture from the cream and turn into small, melting puffs. Since this is a chilled desserts, warmth had to be added: a thick bittersweet chocolate sauce is spooned over the cake right before serving.
Serve this cake during the holidays; it will be all cheer and delight.
Note: Make sure you sift the cake flour before measuring it. I used a 17 1/4- by 11 1/2-inch jelly roll pan for this recipe, but anything in that approximate size will work.","Yield:Serves 10 to 12

For the Hot Chocolate Sauce:
1 cup heavy cream
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt","1.
For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly coat jelly roll pan (See notes) with baking spray. Line with parchment paper and once again lightly coat with baking spray. Dust with 1/4 cup cocoa powder and tap to evenly distribute; knock out excess.
2.
Sift sifted cake flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup sugar, and baking powder. Sift mixture once again, then, place in large bowl.
3.
In medium bowl, whisk egg yolks, oil, and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add to flour mixture and whisk together until combined (mixture will be thick). Whisk in hot water and mix until smooth.
4.
In separate clean, dry mixing bowl, whip egg whites and salt with whisk attachment on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high and gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar; continue whipping until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir 1/3 of egg whites into cake batter until thoroughly combined. With rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining egg whites.
5.
Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread out evenly. Bake until top of cake is pale golden and lightly springs back when you press down on it, about 15 minutes.
6.
While cake bakes, dust clean, dry kitchen towel with remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder.
7.
Run a knife around edges of just-baked cake. Turn cake over onto prepared towel. Starting at the short end, roll cake in towel and place seam-side down on cooling rack. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.
8.
For the Filling: Once the cake is cooled, combine water and gelatin in small bowl. Microwave until gelatin dissolves, about 20 seconds. Cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Beat cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, salt, and dissolved gelatin in large bowl and medium speed with whisk attachment until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add cream, and beat until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat to soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Fold in marshmallows.
9.
To Assemble: Unroll cake, leaving it on towel. Spread cake with marshmallow cream filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Slowly and gently roll the cake, this time without the towel, starting at the short end. Peel off parchment. Place the cake, seam-side down on a baking sheet and refrigerate until filling is firm, about 1 hour.
10.
For the Sauce: Bring cream and salt to simmer in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Alternatively, microwave cream in microwave-safe container. Place chocolate in medium bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate and stir until completely melted. Stir in vanilla and salt.
11.
Slice roll and serve with chocolate sauce.

Eggnog Cream Pie Recipe,,"[Photograph: Lauren Weisenthal]
If you're a fan of store-bought eggnog, this is the pie for you. It's filled with a rich pudding made from eggnog and lightened with clouds of whipped cream. Shaving fresh nutmeg over the top really makes this pie sing. It's sure to please the holiday crowd this season. For the adults in the house, feel free to whisk a few tablespoons of your favorite booze into the egg and sugar mixture.","Yield:serves 8
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:4 hours
Rated: 2.5","Ingredients
20 ounces (2 1/2 cups) store-bought eggnog
1 egg
5 egg yolks
Kosher salt
4 ounces (1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoons) granulated sugar
2 tablespoons corn starch
10 ounces gingersnaps, roughly broken (about 3 cups broken cookies)
4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
8 ounces (1 cup) heavy cream
2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar
Sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg","1.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap and set aside (have additional plastic wrap close at hand). Place the eggnog in a large saucepan and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, yolks, and pinch of salt until they are pale and fluffy. In a small bowl, whisk together starch and sugar and add it to the egg mixture, whisking as you go. Whisk the mixture until smooth and shiny, about 1 minute. Gently heat the eggnog over medium heat, stirring slowly to prevent it from scorching. Once it begins to bubble at the edges, temper the egg mixture with the hot eggnog by ladling the hot eggnog into the bowl in small additions and whisking vigorously as you go. Once the two mixtures are combined, pour the liquid back into the saucepan and whisk it over medium heat. It will thicken. Keep whisking. Once it starts to bubble, continue whisking vigorously for two minutes more. Scrape the pudding onto the prepared baking sheet and press plastic wrap directly on top. Allow the pudding to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer it to the fridge to cool completely, for approximately 3 hours and up to one day.
2.
Place the gingersnaps and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse to grind the cookies down to uniform crumbs, approximately 30 seconds. Add the melted butter and pulse for an additional 15 seconds. Scrape the mixture into a pie plate and using your fingers, press to shape the crumbs into a crust against the bottom and sides of the plate. Chill for 30 minutes and up to one day.
3.
When you are ready to serve: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the heavy cream and confectioner's sugar. Whisk to medium peaks. Remove half of the whipped cream from the bowl and place it in a piping bag fitted with a fluted tip and chill. Add the chilled pudding to the bowl with the remaining cream and whisk until the pudding is smooth and creamy. Pour the pudding into the prepared pie shell and smooth the top with a spatula. Pipe the reserved cream onto the top of the pie. Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and serve immediately.

Waffled Almond Sandwich Cookies Recipe,,"Your eyes may say ""waffle,"" but your taste buds say ""cookie."" [Photograph: Daniel Shumski]
These buttery, lightly sweet almond cookies take a beautiful shape in the waffle iron. They're delicious filled with chocolate ganache, dulce de leche, jam, or lemon curd.
Why this recipe works:
The gently toasted golden brown exterior and waffle grid make these cookies mouthwatering at a glance.
The nutty flavor of the almond cookie is a great fit with the bittersweet chocolate ganache, the caramelized sugar notes of dulce de leche, or the tang of lemon curd.
Note: Different shapes of waffle irons will yield different appearances for your cookies. Testing showed that this recipe works best in standard-type waffle irons (those with shallower divots) as opposed to Belgian-style irons (those with deeper indents). When it comes to the filling, half of this chocolate ganache recipe will yield enough for a full recipe of these sandwich cookies. You can also make your own dulce de leche or find it at your grocer. Ditto for lemon curd.","Yield:Serves about 4 (number of cookies varies depending on waffle iron)
Active time: 30 minutes
Total time:1 hour 30 minutes
Rated: 2","Ingredients
1 large egg yolk
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup almond meal
About 1 cup chocolate ganache, lemon curd, jam, or dulce de leche (amount will vary according to shape of cookies), for filling","1.
In a stand mixer fitter with the whisk, beat egg yolk, butter, sugar, salt, and vanilla at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add flour and almond meal and mix at low speed until just combined.
2.
Place the mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap and top with another piece of plastic wrap, pressing the dough into a disk that holds together.
3.
Chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.
4.
Create a template for shaping the dough: With the waffle iron off, trace your waffle iron’s cooking surface on parchment paper and cut paper to size. (Don't worry if it's not precise.)
5.
Preheat the waffle iron. If it has temperature controls, set it to medium.
6.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a very lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll it out to a rough oval about 1/4 inch thick. Lay the template over the dough and, using a sharp knife, cut out according to the template. Cut another template's worth of dough and then re-roll the scraps of dough and repeat. If there's not enough dough for the full template at the end, roll it to a thickness of 1/4 inch and use it as a test piece or a backup.
7.
Take one piece of the dough, brush off any flour clinging to it, place it on the waffle iron and cook until just golden brown, about 3 minutes. The cookies will be crumbly, so remove them carefully: Use a heatproof spatula to break the pieces into the smallest possible cohesive segment (wedge, square, etc.) so you dont have to support any more weight than necessary when removing from the waffle iron. (If small cracks develop, gently press together; the seam will fuse as it cools.) Set cookies on a wire rack to cool.
8.
Repeat with remaining dough.
9.
To assemble a cookie sandwich: Place a dollop of filling on one cookie and spread to the edges. Start with roughly 1 tablespoon , adding more if necessary. Top with another cookie.
10.
Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Return to room temperature before serving.
